    "lecture_title": "Boundary-layer Transport: Heat, Mass and Momentum Analogies",
    "lecture_summary": "The lecture examines transport processes in a boundary layer over a flat plate, comparing molecular and convective mechanisms for heat, mass and momentum. It defines local and overall transfer coefficients, introduces boundary-layer thicknesses for temperature, concentration and velocity, and connects these thicknesses to dimensionless groups (Reynolds, Prandtl, Schmidt, Nusselt). The Reynolds and Chilton–Colburn analogies are presented to relate heat, mass and momentum transfer, and an example estimates mass-transfer (evaporation) from an empirical heat-transfer correlation.",
