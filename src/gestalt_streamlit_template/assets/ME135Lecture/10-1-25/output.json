The lecture covers how the first and second laws apply to isothermal, reversible adiabatic (isentropic), polytropic and free expansion processes, and shows how to compute work, heat transfer and entropy change for each case. It also situates these processes on p–v diagrams and contrasts their characteristic relations.",
