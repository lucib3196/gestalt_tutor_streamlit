    "lecture_title": "Psychrometric Processes: Humidification, Evaporative Cooling, and Energy Balances",
    "lecture_summary": "This lecture applies psychrometric principles to practical moist-air processes. It shows how to perform mass and energy balances on humidification by steam injection and on evaporative cooling, how to compute humidity ratios and enthalpies from psychrometric data, and how to determine heating/cooling loads and required power (including use of COP). Several worked examples illustrate using steam properties and saturation data to find steam addition, exit conditions, and water consumption rates.",

        "1) Mass (dry-air) conservation: \\(\\dot m_{a1}=\\dot m_{a2}=\\dot m_a\\). (page 1)",
        "2) Specific volume (used to get \\(\\dot m_a\\) from volumetric flow):\n```\nv = \\frac{T(1+\\omega)}{\\dfrac{p_a}{R_a} + \\dfrac{p_v}{R_v}}\n```\n(used to compute \\(\\dot m_a = \\dot V / v\\)). (page 1)",
        "3) Moist-air specific enthalpy per kg dry air (mixture form used throughout):\n```\nh = c_{p,a} T + \\omega\\, h_g(T)\n```\n(where \\(h_g\\) is the specific enthalpy of saturated vapor at temperature T; alternative linearization used in notes: \\(h_g(T)\\approx 2500+1.9T\\)). (pages 1–4)",
        "4) General energy balance across the humidifier / control volume (including steam injection and heat):\n```\n\\dot m_a h_1 + \\dot m_{steam} h_{g,steam} + \\dot Q = \\dot m_a h_2\n```\nDivide by \\(\\dot m_a\\) to express per kg dry air:\n```\nh_1 + (\\omega_2-\\omega_1) h_{g,steam} + \\frac{\\dot Q}{\\dot m_a} = h_2\n```\n(If the spray is adiabatic, \\(\\dot Q=0\\)). (pages 3–4)",
        "5) For adiabatic steam-spray humidifier (common case in notes): set \\(\\dot Q=0\\) and solve for added steam per kg dry air:\n```\n\\boxed{\\;\\omega_2-\\omega_1 = \\dfrac{h_2-h_1}{h_{g,steam}}\\;}\n```\nThis yields mass of steam (kg water per kg dry air). (pages 3–4)",

        "7) If mechanical power of the AC unit is related via coefficient of performance (COP):\n```\n\\dot W = \\dfrac{\\dot Q}{\\mathrm{COP}}\n```\n(used to compute compressor power from cooling load). (page 2)",
        "8) Numerical procedure (as applied in the notes):\n - compute vapor pressures and \\(\\omega\\) from psychrometric relations (e.g. \\(\\omega=0.622\\,p_v/(p-p_v)\\)),\n - compute specific volume \\(v\\) and hence \\(\\dot m_a\\) from volumetric flow,\n - compute \\(h_1,h_2,h_3\\) using \\(h=c_{p,a}T+\\omega h_g(T)\\),\n - use energy balance equations (steps 4–6) to get \\(\\dot Q\\) and \\(\\omega_2-\\omega_1\\),\n - convert to power or mass flow of injected steam: \\(\\dot m_{steam} = \\dot m_a(\\omega_2-\\omega_1)\\). (pages 1–4)",
        "Completeness note: The symbolic derivation (mass & energy balances and resulting boxed expressions) is complete and present in the notes. Numerical substitutions, table lookups (saturated vapor enthalpy/pressure), and intermediate algebraic simplifications are shown but some arithmetic steps are abbreviated in the handwritten work (i.e., table values and numeric algebra are not fully expanded in the images).
