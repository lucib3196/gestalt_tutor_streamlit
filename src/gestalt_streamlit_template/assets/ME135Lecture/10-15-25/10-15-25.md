## Derivations

### **Thermodynamic state calculation for aircraft cabin air-refrigeration cycle (temperatures, pressures, and required coolant mass)**
**Stub:** Determine station temperatures and pressures through ram heating, compression and turbine expansion; compute mass of cooling air required to cool 1 kg main flow in intercooler.

**Steps:**
1. Given: flight speed $V_1 = 900 km/h = 250 m/s$, ground temperature $T_0 = 27°C = 300 K$, altitude $z = 10 km$, lapse rate $Γ = 6°C/km = 0.006 K/m$, $g = 9.81 m/s^2$, $R = 287 J/(kg·K)$, $c_p = 1005 J/(kg·K)$, $γ = 1.4$. Compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies $η_c = η_t = 0.85$. Cabin (ambient) pressure target $p_5 = 101.3 kPa$.
2. Ambient temperature at altitude (state 1):
$$
T_1 = T_0 - Γ z = 300 K - (6 K/km)(10 km) = 300 - 60 = 240 K
$$
3. Ambient (static) pressure at altitude (barometric lapse formula with constant lapse):
$$
\frac{p_1}{p_0} = \left(1 - \frac{Γ z}{T_0}\right)^{g/(R Γ)}
$$
Compute exponent: $g/(R Γ) = 9.81/(287·0.006) ≈ 0.2805$. Then
$$
p_1 ≈ 0.2805 · 101.3\ \mathrm{kPa} = 28.41\ \mathrm{kPa}
$$
4. Ram (stagnation) heating 1→2 (adiabatic compression due to flight speed):
$$
T_2 = T_1 + \frac{V^2}{2 c_p} = 240 + \frac{250^2}{2·1005} ≈ 271.1\ \mathrm{K}
$$
5. Estimate p_2 (after inlet/ram compression) — student uses an approximate value from stagnation/inlet process (intermediate arithmetic in notes):
$$
p_2 ≈ 42\ \mathrm{kPa}\ (approx., from inlet/ram relations shown in notes)
$$
6. Compressor 2→3: given compressor overall pressure ratio across compressor stages $p_3/p_2 = 5$. Thus
$$
p_3 = 5 p_2 ≈ 5 · 42 = 210\ \mathrm{kPa}
$$
7. Isentropic (ideal) temperature rise in compressor:
$$
T_{3s} = T_2 \left(\frac{p_3}{p_2}\right)^{(\gamma-1)/\gamma} = 271.1\cdot 5^{0.4/1.4} ≈ 429.4\ \mathrm{K}
$$
8. Account for compressor isentropic efficiency $η_c = 0.85$ (definition used in notes: $η_c = (T_{3s}-T_2)/(T_3 - T_2)$ → solve for actual $T_3$):
$$
T_3 = T_2 + \frac{T_{3s}-T_2}{η_c} = 271.1 + \frac{429.4-271.1}{0.85} ≈ 457.3\ \mathrm{K}
$$
9. Turbine 3→4: assume expansion to near ambient (student uses $p_4 ≈ 101.3 kPa$). Isentropic turbine outlet temperature:
$$
T_{4s} = T_3 \left(\frac{p_4}{p_3}\right)^{(\gamma-1)/\gamma} = 457.3\cdot\left(\frac{101.3}{210}\right)^{0.4/1.4} ≈ 371.3\ \mathrm{K}
$$
10. Account for turbine isentropic efficiency $η_t = 0.85$. Using turbine efficiency relation $η_t = (T_3 - T_4)/(T_3 - T_{4s})$ → solve for actual $T_4$:
$$
T_4 = T_3 - η_t (T_3 - T_{4s}) = 457.3 - 0.85(457.3 - 371.3) ≈ 384.2\ \mathrm{K}
$$
11. (Student notes/in some pages an alternate numeric $T_4 ≈ 373 K$ is used — there is a small inconsistency in the handwritten arithmetic. Both $T_4 ≈ 384.2 K$ (from strict application above) and the student's used $T_4 ≈ 373 K$ appear in the pages.)
12. Intercooler / mixer energy balance to find mass of cooling air required to cool 1 kg of main flow: energy balance between main flow (3→4) and cooling stream (6→2):
$$
\dot m_{cool} c_p (T_6 - T_2) = 1\cdot c_p (T_3 - T_4)  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
\dot m_{cool} = \frac{T_3 - T_4}{T_6 - T_2}
$$
Student uses $T_6 = 310 K$ and the values above. Using the student's numbers (they used $T_4 ≈ 373 K$) gives
$$
\dot m_{cool} ≈ \frac{457.3 - 373}{310 - 271.1} = \frac{84.3}{38.9} ≈ 2.16\ \mathrm{kg\ cooling\ air\ per\ kg\ main}
$$
13. Note on alternate value: using the $T_4 ≈ 384.2 K$ result from the turbine-efficiency calculation gives
$$
\dot m_{cool} ≈ \frac{457.3 - 384.2}{310 - 271.1} = \frac{73.1}{38.9} ≈ 1.88\ \mathrm{kg/kg}
$$
14. Completeness / assumptions: derivation follows the student's chain and is mostly complete. Assumptions made (explicit or implicit): ideal gas with constant $c_p$, $γ = 1.4$, frictionless inlet except for ram heating as applied, isentropic relations for stages with given isentropic efficiencies. Missing / approximate items: explicit intermediate arithmetic for $p_2$ (inlet/rise from $p_1$ to $p_2$) is not fully shown, and slightly inconsistent numeric values for $T_4$ appear in different pages which changes the final mass ratio slightly. Overall logical steps are present and sufficient to reproduce results if the $p_2$ and the choice of the used $T_4$ are clarified.

### **Barometric pressure with linear lapse rate (altitude pressure relation)**
**Stub:** Derive $p(z)$ from hydrostatic equilibrium with constant lapse $Γ$ giving $p_1/p_0 = (1 - Γ z / T_0)^{g/(R Γ)}$.

**Steps:**
1. Hydrostatic + ideal gas with linear lapse $T(z) = T_0 - Γ z$ → integrate $dp/p = -(g/(R T(z))) dz$ to get
$$
\frac{p(z)}{p_0} = \left(1 - \frac{Γ z}{T_0}\right)^{g/(R Γ)}
$$
2. Evaluate at $z = 10 km$ with $g/(R Γ) ≈ 0.2805$ → $p_1 ≈ 0.2805 p_0 ≈ 28.41 kPa$.

### **Isentropic compression/expansion relations**
**Stub:** Use isentropic relations $T_2/T_1 = (p_2/p_1)^{(γ-1)/γ}$ to compute ideal (s) temperatures for compressor and turbine.

**Steps:**
1. Compressor ideal rise:
$$
T_{3s} = T_2 \left(\frac{p_3}{p_2}\right)^{(\gamma-1)/\gamma}
$$
2. Turbine ideal drop:
$$
T_{4s} = T_3 \left(\frac{p_4}{p_3}\right)^{(\gamma-1)/\gamma}
$$
3. Use isentropic efficiencies: compressor $η_c = (T_{3s}-T_2)/(T_3 - T_2)$, turbine $η_t = (T_3 - T_4)/(T_3 - T_{4s})$ to find actual outlet temperatures.

**Reference:** start_page=2 end_page=3
### **Intercooler/mixer energy balance (mass ratio)**
**Stub:** Relate temperature changes to find cooling mass flow required: $m_c = (T_3 - T_4)/(T_6 - T_2)$ for 1 kg main flow.

**Steps:**
1. Steady energy balance (per kg main flow):
$$
c_p (T_3 - T_4) = \dot m_{cool} c_p (T_6 - T_2) \quad\Rightarrow\quad \dot m_{cool} = \frac{T_3 - T_4}{T_6 - T_2}
$$
2. Plugging student numbers ($T_3 ≈ 457.3 K$, $T_6 = 310 K$, $T_2 = 271.1 K$) and using the student's $T_4$ value gives $\dot m_{cool} ≈ 2.16 kg/kg$ (notes show a small alternative $\dot m ≈ 1.88 kg/kg$ if the alternate $T_4$ is used).

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** What is the primary purpose of the intercooler between compressor stages in the multi-stage air-refrigeration system shown, and how does it affect compressor work?

**Topics:** Intercooling, Multi-stage compression, Compressor work and efficiency

**Options:**
- It increases total compression work by adding an extra component to the cycle.
- ✅ It reduces the work required by the compressors by cooling the air between stages, lowering specific volume and the temperature entering the next stage.
- It raises the interstage pressure so a single-stage compressor can be used instead.
- It prevents condensation by raising the air temperature between stages.

**Explanation:** Cooling the compressed air between stages reduces its specific volume and the temperature that the next stage must compress from. That lowers the ideal and actual compression work for the combined stages, improving overall efficiency.

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=5
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** In a vapour-compression refrigeration cycle, what is the thermodynamic character of the throttling (expansion) valve process through the Joule–Thomson (throttle) device?

**Topics:** Vapour-compression cycle, Throttling (Joule–Thomson) process, Enthalpy and phase change

**Options:**
- Isentropic (entropy constant); temperature increases while enthalpy decreases.
- ✅ Isenthalpic (enthalpy constant); pressure drops and temperature (or quality) changes, leading to partial vaporization.
- Isobaric (pressure constant); temperature remains constant while enthalpy decreases.
- Adiabatic and reversible; results in maximum useful work output from the refrigerant.

**Explanation:** The throttle valve is modeled as a Joule–Thomson (isenthalpic) device: enthalpy remains essentially constant across the valve while pressure drops. This causes a temperature/quality change (partial vaporization) that provides the low-temperature refrigerant for the evaporator.

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=5
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** How does a compressor isentropic efficiency less than 100% affect the actual compressor outlet temperature and the work input compared with the ideal (isentropic) case?

**Topics:** Isentropic efficiency, Compressor thermodynamics, Actual vs ideal processes

**Options:**
- Actual outlet temperature is lower than the ideal isentropic outlet and actual work input is less than the ideal work.
- Actual outlet temperature equals the ideal isentropic outlet; isentropic efficiency only affects pressure.
- ✅ Actual outlet temperature is higher than the ideal isentropic outlet and actual work input is greater than the ideal work.
- Isentropic efficiency only affects turbine behavior, not compressors.

**Explanation:** With isentropic efficiency <100% the compression is less ideal: for the same pressure ratio the actual temperature rise is larger than the ideal isentropic rise, so the compressor must consume more work than predicted by the ideal (isentropic) compression.
