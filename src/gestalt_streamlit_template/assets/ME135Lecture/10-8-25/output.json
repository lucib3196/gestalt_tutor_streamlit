    "lecture_summary": "The lecture introduces conservation laws for control volumes (mass, energy, entropy, linear and angular momentum) and applies them to common devices: compressors, turbines, and heat exchangers. It defines isentropic efficiency and uses temperature‑entropy diagrams to compare ideal and real processes. The reversed Brayton (air refrigeration) cycle is analyzed, including definition of work terms and coefficient of performance, followed by a worked numerical example to compute net work, mass flow and compressor power for a given cooling load.",
