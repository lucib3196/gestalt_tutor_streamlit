## Open‑System Thermodynamics and the Reversed Brayton Refrigeration Cycle

**Lecture Type:** mixed

### Summary
The lecture introduces conservation laws for control volumes (mass, energy, entropy, linear and angular momentum) and applies them to common devices: compressors, turbines, and heat exchangers. It defines isentropic efficiency and uses temperature‑entropy diagrams to compare ideal and real processes. The reversed Brayton (air refrigeration) cycle is analyzed, including definition of work terms and coefficient of performance, followed by a worked numerical example to compute net work, mass flow and compressor power for a given cooling load.

## Derivations

### **Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the Reversed Brayton (Joule) Refrigeration Cycle**
**Stub:** Derive the COP for a reversed Brayton refrigeration cycle: $$\mathrm{COP}=\dfrac{q_c}{w_{net}}=\dfrac{h_1-h_4}{(h_2-h_1)-(h_3-h_4)}$$ where h_i are stagnation/flow enthalpies at states 1–4.

**Steps:**
1. Cycle description and process assumptions: 1→2 is isentropic compression, 2→3 is constant-pressure heat rejection (to environment), 3→4 is isentropic expansion (turbine), 4→1 is constant-pressure heat addition (evaporator). Steady-flow, neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy. (Diagram: compressor at 1→2, heat rejection at 2→3, turbine at 3→4, heat addition at 4→1.)
2. Define specific work for compressor (per unit mass): assuming adiabatic, reversible (isentropic) compression, the shaft work input (specific) is the enthalpy rise:  $$w_{comp}=h_2-h_1.$$
3. Define specific work produced by turbine (per unit mass): for isentropic expansion, shaft work output is enthalpy drop: $$w_{turb}=h_3-h_4.$$ (Note sign convention: positive w_comp is input; w_turb is output.)
4. Net specific work required (machine input) is compressor work minus turbine work (compressor consumes net work): $$w_{net}=w_{comp}-w_{turb}=(h_2-h_1)-(h_3-h_4).$$
5. Heat extracted (cooling) at the evaporator (per unit mass) is the enthalpy difference across 4→1: $$q_c=h_1-h_4.$$
6. Coefficient of performance (COP) is cooling delivered per unit net work input: $$\mathrm{COP}=\dfrac{q_c}{w_{net}}=\dfrac{h_1-h_4}{(h_2-h_1)-(h_3-h_4)}.$$
7. Optional connection to ideal-gas isentropic T–p relations (used when evaluating enthalpies with ideal-gas cp): for isentropic steps $$\dfrac{T_2}{T_1}=\left(\dfrac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{(\gamma-1)/\gamma},\quad \dfrac{T_3}{T_4}=\left(\dfrac{P_3}{P_4}\right)^{(\gamma-1)/\gamma},$$ and for calorically perfect gas $$h=C_pT.$$ These give the same algebraic COP expression once h's are replaced by CpT where appropriate.
8. Completeness / assumptions: derivation is symbolically complete for the steady-flow ideal reversed Brayton cycle. To obtain numeric COP values one substitutes enthalpy (or Cp·T) values and evaluates isentropic relations; if non-ideal (isentropic efficiencies <100%) or kinetic/potential effects matter, additional terms (efficiencies, ke/pe) must be included. (Reference: pages with the cycle diagram and symbolic COP expression appear in the notes.)

### **General Open-System (Control Volume) Balances — Mass and Energy (steady and transient forms)**
**Stub:** Statement of integral/balance form for open systems: mass and energy balances relating mass flow, transfer, generation, and accumulation; steady-flow simplifications.

**Steps:**
1. General symbolic balance (mass or any extensive property X) for a control volume (CV): $$\dot{X}_{in}-\dot{X}_{out}+\dot{X}_{transf}+\dot{X}_{gen}=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}X_{CV}.$$ (Shown at top of page 1 with sketch of control volume and mass transfer term.)
2. Mass balance (no mass generation, possibly mass transfer at boundaries): $$\dot{m}_i-\dot{m}_o+\dot{m}_{transf}+\dot{m}_{gen}=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}m_{CV}.$$ If no mass transfer at boundaries and no mass generation: $$\dot{m}_i-\dot{m}_o=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}m_{CV}.$$ Steady state (\partial/\partial t=0) gives: $$\dot{m}_i=\dot{m}_o.$$
3. Energy balance for open system (per unit time): general steady-flow energy equation including enthalpy, kinetic, potential, heat and work: $$\dot{m}_i\left(h_i+\dfrac{v_i^2}{2}+gz_i\right)-\dot{m}_o\left(h_o+\dfrac{v_o^2}{2}+gz_o\right)+\dot{Q}-\dot{W}=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}E_{CV}.$$ (Notes show simplified steady-flow forms and define E_cv.)
4. Entropy statement (control volume): mass flow entropy terms plus entropy transfer by heat and entropy generation: $$\dot{m}_i s_i-\dot{m}_o s_o+\int\dfrac{\delta \dot{Q}_{rev}}{T}+\dot{\Sigma}=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}S_{CV},$$ where \dot{\Sigma} is entropy generated (>=0).
5. Linear and angular momentum balances are given symbolically: linear momentum: $$\dot{m}_i v_i-\dot{m}_o v_o+\sum F=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}(m_{CV}v_{CV}),$$ angular momentum (symbolic): $$(r_i\times\dot{m}_i v_i)-(r_o\times\dot{m}_o v_o)+\sum T=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}(r\times m v)_{CV}.$$

### **Compressor and Turbine Ideal Steady-Flow Energy Relations**
**Stub:** For steady-flow adiabatic (Q̇=0) devices, relate work to enthalpy change: compressor work input and turbine work output per unit mass.

**Steps:**
1. General steady-flow energy balance for a device (neglecting ke/pe and accumulation): $$\dot{m}(h_i)-\dot{m}(h_o)+\dot{Q}-\dot{W}=0.$$ For adiabatic device (\dot{Q}=0) this reduces to $$\dot{W}=\dot{m}(h_i-h_o)\quad(\text{signs per chosen convention}).$$
2. Ideal (reversible) compressor (adiabatic): with Q̇=0 and isentropic compression, shaft power input (rate) $$\dot{W}=\dot{m}(h_2-h_1),\quad w=\dfrac{\dot{W}}{\dot{m}}=h_2-h_1.$$ For an ideal gas with constant cp this becomes $$w=C_p(T_2-T_1).$$
3. Ideal turbine (adiabatic, isentropic expansion): with Q̇=0 and isentropic expansion, shaft power output $$\dot{W}=\dot{m}(h_3-h_4),\quad w=h_3-h_4.$$
4. Isentropic ideal-gas temperature–pressure relation (used to compute h via CpT if needed): $$\dfrac{T_2}{T_1}=\left(\dfrac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{(\gamma-1)/\gamma}.$$

### **Heat Exchanger Steady-Flow Energy and Entropy Expressions**
**Stub:** Energy transfer in a steady-flow heat exchanger: heat transfer per unit mass equals enthalpy rise; entropy change for ideal gas across heat exchanger.

**Steps:**
1. Steady-flow energy balance across heat exchanger (neglecting work): $$\dot{m}h_i-\dot{m}h_o+\dot{Q}=0\quad\Rightarrow\quad\dot{Q}=\dot{m}(h_o-h_i).$$ Per unit mass: $$q=\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{\dot{m}}=h_o-h_i.$$
2. For an ideal gas with constant cp, specific heat added per unit mass: $$q=C_p(T_o-T_i).$$
3. Entropy change for ideal gas across the exchanger (when pressures at inlet/outlet are equal or pressure-change term negligible): $$\Delta s=C_p\ln\dfrac{T_o}{T_i}-R\ln\dfrac{P_o}{P_i}.$$ If $P_o\approx P_i$ (no pressure change in exchanger) the pressure term drops and $$\Delta s=C_p\ln\dfrac{T_o}{T_i}.$$

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** For a control volume operating at steady state with no mass transfer through its walls and no mass generation inside, which of the following mass balances is correct?

**Topics:** Mass balance, Open systems (control volumes), Steady state

**Options:**
- ✅ Mass flow in equals mass flow out (ṁ_in = ṁ_out).
- Time derivative of mass in the control volume equals mass flow in minus mass flow out (dm_cv/dt = ṁ_in − ṁ_out).
- Mass flow in minus mass flow out equals the mass generation rate inside the control volume.
- Mass flow out equals zero since there is no mass transfer through the walls.

**Explanation:** At steady state dm_cv/dt = 0 and with no internal mass generation the mass balance reduces to ṁ_in − ṁ_out = 0, so ṁ_in = ṁ_out.

 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which expression correctly defines the isentropic (ideal) efficiency of a compressor?

**Topics:** Compressor performance, Isentropic process, Enthalpy/Work relations

**Options:**
- ✅ η_isentropic = (h2s − h1) / (h2 − h1) — ratio of ideal (isentropic) compressor work to actual compressor work.
- η_isentropic = (h2 − h1) / (h2s − h1) — ratio of actual work to ideal work.
- η_isentropic = q̇_in / ẇ_comp — ratio of heat added to compressor work.
- η_isentropic = (T_out − T_in) / (T_isentropic_out − T_in) — ratio of temperature rises (always >1).

**Explanation:** Compressor isentropic efficiency is defined as the ideal (isentropic) work divided by the actual work for the compression: η = (h2s−h1)/(h2−h1). The second option is the reciprocal and incorrect.

**Reference:** start_page=2 end_page=2
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** In the reversed Brayton (open-cycle) refrigeration cycle shown, which sequence correctly describes the four processes (1→2, 2→3, 3→4, 4→1)?

**Topics:** Reversed Brayton cycle, Thermodynamic processes, Refrigeration system components

**Options:**
- ✅ 1→2: isentropic compression; 2→3: constant-pressure heat rejection; 3→4: isentropic expansion; 4→1: constant-pressure heat addition.
- 1→2: constant-pressure heat addition; 2→3: isentropic compression; 3→4: constant-pressure heat rejection; 4→1: isentropic expansion.
- 1→2: isentropic expansion; 2→3: constant-volume heat rejection; 3→4: isentropic compression; 4→1: constant-pressure heat addition.
- 1→2: isothermal compression; 2→3: isentropic heat rejection; 3→4: isothermal expansion; 4→1: isentropic heat addition.

**Explanation:** The reversed Brayton refrigeration cycle uses isentropic compression (1→2), then constant-pressure heat rejection (2→3), isentropic expansion (3→4), and constant-pressure heat addition (4→1). This sequence yields the cooling at the low-pressure heat exchanger.
