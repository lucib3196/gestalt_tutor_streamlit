    "lecture_summary": "This lecture analyzes the flow through a single stage centrifugal turbomachine. It introduces velocity triangles at inlet and outlet, defines absolute and relative velocity components and blade angles, and applies conservation of angular momentum to derive Euler's turbomachinery equation for work transfer. The notes then connect the mechanical work to thermodynamic quantities (stagnation enthalpy and temperature), discuss a radial-entry special case, and outline how to use isentropic relations to estimate exit pressure and stage efficiency.",
