## Derivations

### **Humidity ratio (mixing ratio) w = 0.622 · p_v / (p − p_v)**
**Stub:** Derive the humidity (mixing) ratio w = m_v / m_a in terms of total pressure p and vapor partial pressure p_v: w = 0.622 · p_v / (p − p_v).

**Steps:**
1. Define humidity ratio (mixing ratio):

w = m_v / m_a
2. Treat both water vapor and dry air as ideal gases. Write mass from ideal-gas relation (per component):

For vapor: $$m_v = \dfrac{p_v V}{R_v T}$$
For dry air: $$m_a = \dfrac{p_a V}{R_a T}$$
(where R_v and R_a are the specific gas constants for vapor and dry air respectively).
3. Form the ratio and cancel common factors (V,T):

$$w = \dfrac{m_v}{m_a} = \dfrac{p_v / R_v}{p_a / R_a} = \dfrac{p_v}{p_a}\cdot\dfrac{R_a}{R_v}.$$
4. Express the ratio of specific gas constants using molecular weights (R_i = R_u / M_i):

$$\dfrac{R_a}{R_v} = \dfrac{M_v}{M_a}\approx\dfrac{18}{28.96}\approx 0.622.$$
5. Use Dalton's law for the partial pressure of dry air: $$p_a = p - p_v$$ (total pressure minus vapor pressure). Substitute into w:

$$w = 0.622\;\dfrac{p_v}{p - p_v}.$$
6. Result boxed: 

```
$$w = 0.622\dfrac{p_v}{p - p_v}\quad\text{(kg vapour / kg dry air)}$$
```
7. Completeness: derivation is complete (assumes ideal-gas behavior and that p is the total pressure so p_a = p - p_v).

### **Dalton's law → partial pressures and mole-fraction relation**
**Stub:** Show that each component partial pressure equals its mole fraction times total pressure: p_i = (n_i / n) · p.

**Steps:**
1. Start from ideal-gas law for a component and for the mixture:

For component i: $$p_i V = n_i \bar{R} T.$$
For mixture: $$p V = n \bar{R} T.$$
2. Divide component equation by mixture equation (or compare):

$$\dfrac{p_i V}{p V} = \dfrac{n_i \bar{R} T}{n \bar{R} T} \Rightarrow \dfrac{p_i}{p} = \dfrac{n_i}{n}$$
3. Define mole fraction: $$y_i \equiv \dfrac{n_i}{n}$$ so

$$p_i = y_i\,p.$$
4. Conclude Dalton's law in mixture form: total pressure is sum of partial pressures, $$p = \sum_i p_i,$$ and each partial equals mole fraction times p.
5. Purpose / how it supports main derivation: provides p_a = p - p_v (used to substitute p_a when deriving w), and justifies using p_v and p as component pressures.
6. Completeness: derivation is complete and standard; assumes ideal-gas mixture.

### **Relative humidity and dew-point relation: φ = p_v / p_sat and dew-point determination**
**Stub:** Derive relative humidity φ = m_v / m_{v,sat} = p_v / p_{sat} and state how to find dew point from p_v (interpolation).

**Steps:**
1. Define relative humidity as ratio of actual vapor mass to saturated vapor mass at same T:

$$\phi = \dfrac{m_v}{m_{v,\mathrm{sat}}}.$$
2. Using ideal-gas expression for masses (same V and T for actual and saturated vapor):

$$m_v = \dfrac{p_v V}{R_v T},\quad m_{v,\mathrm{sat}} = \dfrac{p_{\mathrm{sat}}(T)\,V}{R_v T}.$$
3. Cancel V, R_v, T to obtain:

$$\phi = \dfrac{p_v}{p_{\mathrm{sat}}(T)}.$$
4. Hence given φ and temperature T, the vapor partial pressure is

$$p_v = \phi\,p_{\mathrm{sat}}(T).$$
To find the dew-point temperature T_dp, solve for T such that

$$p_{\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\mathrm{dp}}) = p_v.$$
5. Practical dew-point interpolation (as used in notes): if table values p_{sat}(T1)=p1 and p_{sat}(T2)=p2 bracket p_v, then linear interpolation for T_dp:

$$T_{\mathrm{dp}} = T_1 + \dfrac{p_v - p_1}{p_2 - p_1}\,(T_2 - T_1).$$
(Used when p_v falls between tabulated saturation pressures.)
6. Completeness: derivation for φ = p_v/p_sat is complete under ideal-gas assumption. Dew-point step assumes monotonic p_sat(T) and uses linear interpolation (approximate).

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** According to Dalton's law for an ideal gas mixture, which expression gives the partial pressure pA of component A?

**Topics:** Dalton's law, Partial pressure, Mole fraction

**Options:**
- ✅ pA = (nA / n) · P
- pA = (mA / m) · P
- pA = (MA / M) · P  (MA = molar mass of A)
- pA = P − (nA / n) · P

**Explanation:** For an ideal gas mixture the partial pressure of A equals its mole fraction yA = nA/n times the total pressure P, i.e. pA = yA·P.

 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which formula correctly expresses the humidity ratio w (kg water vapour per kg dry air) in terms of vapour partial pressure pv and total pressure P (assuming ideal gases and molecular weights of dry air and vapour)?

**Topics:** Humidity ratio, Vapour pressure, Ideal gas relations

**Options:**
- ✅ w = 0.622 · pv / (P − pv)
- w = pv / (P − pv)
- w = 0.622 · (P − pv) / pv
- w = 0.278 · pv / (P − pv)

**Explanation:** Derived from ideal-gas relations and molar masses (Mw/Ma ≈ 18/28.96 ≈ 0.622), the humidity ratio is w = (Mv/Ma)·pv/(P−pv) ≈ 0.622·pv/(P−pv).

 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Relative humidity φ is defined as which of the following (for a given temperature)?

**Topics:** Relative humidity, Saturation pressure, Dew point concepts

**Options:**
- ✅ φ = pv / psat(T)
- φ = psat(T) / pv
- φ = pv / P (total pressure)
- φ = (P − pv) / psat(T)

**Explanation:** Relative humidity is the ratio of the actual vapour partial pressure pv to the saturation vapour pressure at the same temperature psat(T): φ = pv/psat.
