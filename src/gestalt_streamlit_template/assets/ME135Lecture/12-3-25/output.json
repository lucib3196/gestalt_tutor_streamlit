    "lecture_title": "Integral Momentum Method for Laminar Boundary Layer on a Flat Plate",
    "lecture_summary": "This lecture introduces the integral momentum method to analyze a laminar boundary layer developing on a flat plate. It explains how mass and momentum balances applied to a control volume enclosing the boundary layer lead to the momentum integral equation, defines the momentum thickness as a characteristic integral measure of the profile, and shows how to obtain wall shear and skin-friction coefficients by combining the integral result with the viscous shear at the wall. An example using a linear velocity profile is worked through to obtain scaling laws for boundary-layer thickness and local/average skin-friction behavior with Reynolds number.",
