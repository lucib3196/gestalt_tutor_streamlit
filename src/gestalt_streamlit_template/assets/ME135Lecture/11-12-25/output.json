It shows how to compute heat transfer rate, required surface area, and outlet temperatures using both LMTD and effectiveness/NTU relations, and presents example calculations illustrating the methods and the definition of capacity rates and capacity ratio.",

      "derivation_stub": "Derive \\(\\displaystyle \\varepsilon = \\frac{1 - e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 + C_r)}}{1 + C_r} \\) (and equivalent NTU inversion).",
      "steps": [
        "1) Define actual heat transfer and effectiveness: $$\\dot{Q} = C_h( T_{hi} - T_{ho} ) = C_c( T_{co} - T_{ci} ),\\quad \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{\\dot{Q}_{\\max}}.$$",
        "2) Maximum possible heat transfer (if the fluid with minimum heat capacity were to undergo the maximum possible temperature change) gives $$\\dot{Q}_{\\max} = C_{\\min}(T_{hi} - T_{ci}).$$ Hence one convenient expression for effectiveness is $$\\varepsilon = \\frac{T_{hi}-T_{ho}}{T_{hi}-T_{ci}} = \\frac{T_{co}-T_{ci}}{C_r\\,(T_{hi}-T_{ci})},$$ where $$C_r \\equiv \\frac{C_{\\min}}{C_{\\max}}.$$",
        "3) From the integrated energy/differential result (derived separately) we have the logarithmic relation between inlet/outlet temperature differences for a parallel flow exchanger: $$\\ln\\frac{T_{ho}-T_{co}}{T_{hi}-T_{ci}} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{C_h}+\\frac{1}{C_c}\\right)UA.$$",
        "4) Re-arrange the log relation in terms of C_min, C_max and C_r. Let \\(C_{\\min}=C_{\\text{min}}\\). Using \\(\\frac{1}{C_h}+\\frac{1}{C_c} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\min}}\\left(1 + C_r\\right)\\) (after identifying which side is min/max and defining \\(C_r=C_{\\min}/C_{\\max}\\)), and define the NTU number as $$\\mathrm{NTU}\\equiv\\frac{UA}{C_{\\min}}.$$ The logarithmic relation becomes $$\\ln\\frac{T_{ho}-T_{co}}{T_{hi}-T_{ci}} = -\\mathrm{NTU}\\,(1+C_r).$$",
        "5) Express the left-hand side in terms of effectiveness. Note that $$T_{ho}-T_{co} = (T_{hi}-T_{ci}) - (T_{hi}-T_{ho}) - (T_{co}-T_{ci}),$$ and using the definitions of \\(\\varepsilon\\) and \\(C_r\\) we obtain an equation of the form $$1 - \\varepsilon(1+C_r) = e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}(1+C_r)}.$$",
        "6) Solve algebraically for \\(\\varepsilon\\): $$\\varepsilon = \\frac{1 - e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}(1+C_r)}}{1+C_r}.$$ This is the standard effectiveness–NTU relation for parallel flow (boxed).",
        "7) Invert to obtain NTU (useful if \\(\\varepsilon\\) known): $$\\mathrm{NTU} = -\\frac{1}{1+C_r} \\ln\\left[1-\\varepsilon(1+C_r)\\right].$$",
        "Completeness note: The derivation on the slides is complete — it shows the logarithmic integration step, substitution of \\(UA/C_{\\min}=\\mathrm{NTU}\\), and algebraic rearrangement to obtain the boxed result and the inverted NTU expression."

      "steps": [
        "1) Consider an infinitesimal element of length \\(\\Delta x\\). Energy balance on the hot fluid (capacity \\(C_h\\)) gives $$C_h\\,[T_h(x)+\\frac{dT_h}{dx}\\Delta x - T_h(x)] = -\\delta\\dot q \\;\\Rightarrow\\; C_h\\frac{dT_h}{dx}\\Delta x = -\\delta\\dot q.$$",
        "2) Similarly, cold fluid (capacity \\(C_c\\)) balance gives $$C_c\\frac{dT_c}{dx}\\Delta x = +\\delta\\dot q.$$",
        "3) Subtract the two to get the equation for the temperature difference: $$\\frac{d}{dx}(T_h - T_c) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{C_h}+\\frac{1}{C_c}\\right)\\delta\\dot q/\\Delta x.$$",
        "4) Relate local heat transfer to temperature difference through the heat transfer coefficient: $$\\delta\\dot q = U\\,W\\,\\Delta x\\,(T_h(x)-T_c(x)),$$ where \\(W\\) is the perimeter (so that \\(UA = UWL\\)).",
        "5) Substitute and separate variables: $$\\frac{d(T_h-T_c)}{T_h-T_c} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{C_h}+\\frac{1}{C_c}\\right)U W\\,dx.$$",
        "6) Integrate along the exchanger from inlet to outlet to obtain $$\\ln\\frac{T_{ho}-T_{co}}{T_{hi}-T_{ci}} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{C_h}+\\frac{1}{C_c}\\right)U W L = -\\left(\\frac{1}{C_h}+\\frac{1}{C_c}\\right) UA.$$",
        "7) Using the definition \\(\\mathrm{NTU}=UA/C_{\\min}\\) and algebra, this relation is the starting point for the effectiveness–NTU derivation. Separately, combining Q=UA(LMTD) yields the LMTD formula: $$\\mathrm{LMTD}=\\frac{\\Delta T_i-\\Delta T_o}{\\ln(\\Delta T_i/\\Delta T_o)},\\quad\\dot Q = UA\\times\\mathrm{LMTD}.$$",
        "Completeness note: The slide derivation is explicit for the differential balances and the integration; the step from the integrated log expression to the effectiveness form is carried out in the main derivation."

        "2) Take the limit \\(C_r\\to 0\\): the numerator becomes \\(1 - e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}}\\) and denominator approaches 1, so $$\\varepsilon\\to 1 - e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}}.$$",
        "3) The slides also show the alternative derivation for the case of an exchanger where the cold or hot side capacity is effectively infinite (all exchangers with \\(C_r=0\\)), giving the boxed relation $$\\varepsilon = 1 - e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}}.$$$",
