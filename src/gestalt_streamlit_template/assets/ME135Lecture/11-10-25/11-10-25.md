## Heat Exchangers and Thermal-Resistance Analysis for Flat and Cylindrical Walls

**Lecture Type:** mixed

Introduces common heat exchanger configurations and develops the thermal-resistance approach to predict heat transfer. The lecture explains the concept of an overall heat transfer coefficient and shows how convective and conductive resistances combine in series for planar and cylindrical geometries. It derives the temperature distribution and heat rate for radial conduction through a cylinder and applies the resistance network to shell-and-tube and crossflow exchanger examples.

## Derivations

### **Steady radial conduction through a cylindrical wall and total thermal resistance with convective boundaries**
**Stub:** Derive steady-state heat transfer through a hollow cylinder and express \dot{Q} in terms of surface temperatures and an equivalent thermal resistance (including inner and outer convection): $$\dot{Q}=\dfrac{2\pi k L (T_{s1}-T_{s2})}{\ln(R_2/R_1)}\quad\text{and}\quad\dot{Q}=\dfrac{T_i-T_o}{R_{tot}}$$

**Steps:**
1. Energy balance on a thin cylindrical shell (steady state): $$\dot{Q}(r)-\dot{Q}(r+\Delta r)=0 \ \Rightarrow\ \frac{d\dot{Q}}{dr}=0\ \Rightarrow\ \dot{Q}=\text{constant in r.}$$
2. Fourier's law in radial coordinate: heat flux through cylindrical surface of radius r and length L with area $A(r)=2\pi r L$ gives $$\dot{Q} = -k A(r)\frac{dT}{dr} = -k(2\pi r L)\frac{dT}{dr}.$$
3. Rearrange to separate variables: $$\frac{dT}{dr} = -\frac{\dot{Q}}{2\pi k L}\cdot\frac{1}{r}.$$
4. Integrate with respect to r (constant \dot{Q}): $$T(r)= -\frac{\dot{Q}}{2\pi k L}\ln r + C_2 \quad\text{(equivalently }T(r)=C_1\ln r + C_2\text{ with }C_1=-\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{2\pi k L}).$$
5. Apply boundary conditions at the inner and outer solid surfaces: $$T(R_1)=T_{s1},\qquad T(R_2)=T_{s2}.$$ Subtract the two expressions to eliminate C_2: $$T_{s1}-T_{s2}=C_1\ln\frac{R_1}{R_2}.$$
6. Solve for \dot{Q} using $C_1=-\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{2\pi k L}$: $$\begin{aligned}C_1&=\dfrac{T_{s1}-T_{s2}}{\ln(R_1/R_2)}\\[4pt] -\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{2\pi k L}&=\dfrac{T_{s1}-T_{s2}}{\ln(R_1/R_2)}\\[4pt]\Rightarrow\ \dot{Q}&=\dfrac{2\pi k L (T_{s1}-T_{s2})}{\ln(R_2/R_1)}.\end{aligned}$$
7. Define the radial conduction resistance of the cylindrical shell as $$R_{cond}=\dfrac{\ln(R_2/R_1)}{2\pi k L},$$ so the conduction-only form is $$\dot{Q}=\dfrac{T_{s1}-T_{s2}}{R_{cond}}.$$
8. Include convective heat transfer at inner and outer fluid–solid interfaces. Inner convective resistance: $$R_{conv,i}=\dfrac{1}{h_i A_i}=\dfrac{1}{h_i(2\pi R_1 L)}.$$ Outer convective resistance: $$R_{conv,o}=\dfrac{1}{h_o A_o}=\dfrac{1}{h_o(2\pi R_2 L)}.$$
9. Series combination (inner convection → conduction → outer convection) gives total thermal resistance: $$R_{tot}=R_{conv,i}+R_{cond}+R_{conv,o} = \dfrac{1}{h_i2\pi R_1 L}+\dfrac{\ln(R_2/R_1)}{2\pi k L}+\dfrac{1}{h_o2\pi R_2 L}.$$
10. Relate bulk fluid temperatures (inner bulk temperature $T_i$ and outer bulk $T_o$) to heat rate: $$\dot{Q}=\dfrac{T_i-T_o}{R_{tot}}.$$ Equivalently, define an overall conductance (or UA) as $$\frac{1}{UA}=R_{tot}\quad\Rightarrow\quad\dot{Q}=UA\,(T_i-T_o).$$
11. Assumptions and completeness: derivation assumes steady state, constant thermal conductivity k, no heat generation, one-dimensional radial conduction, and well-defined convective coefficients h_i,h_o. The derivation as presented on the slides is complete under these assumptions (all algebraic steps and boundary-condition application are shown).

### **Series convective–conductive–convective resistance for a plane slab (flat wall)**
**Stub:** Derive heat flux through a slab with convection on both sides and express overall U: $$\dot{Q} = U A (T_L-T_R),\quad U=\dfrac{1}{\dfrac{1}{h_L}+\dfrac{L}{k}+\dfrac{1}{h_R}}$$

**Steps:**
1. At steady state the heat rate is equal through left convection, conduction through the slab, and right convection: $$\dot{Q}_{conv,L}=\dot{Q}_{cond}=\dot{Q}_{conv,R}=\dot{Q}.$$
2. Write the temperature drops across each element: $$T_L-T_{s1}=\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{h_L A},\quad T_{s1}-T_{s2}=\dfrac{\dot{Q}L}{kA},\quad T_{s2}-T_R=\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{h_R A}.$$
3. Sum drops: $$T_L-T_R=\dot{Q}\Big(\dfrac{1}{h_L A}+\dfrac{L}{kA}+\dfrac{1}{h_R A}\Big)$$ and rearrange to get $$\dot{Q}=\dfrac{A(T_L-T_R)}{\dfrac{1}{h_L}+\dfrac{L}{k}+\dfrac{1}{h_R}}.$$
4. Define overall heat-transfer coefficient $$U=\dfrac{1}{\dfrac{1}{h_L}+\dfrac{L}{k}+\dfrac{1}{h_R}}$$ so that $$\dot{Q}=UA(T_L-T_R).$$

### **Solution form for radial temperature distribution in cylinder**
**Stub:** Solve integrated ODE for T(r): $$T(r)=C_1\ln r + C_2\quad\text{with }C_1=-\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{2\pi k L}$$

**Steps:**
1. From separation and integration of $$\dfrac{dT}{dr}=-\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{2\pi k L}\cdot\dfrac{1}{r}$$ we obtain $$T(r)= -\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{2\pi k L}\ln r + C_2.$$
2. Express constants by applying boundary conditions at r=R1 and r=R2 and solve for C1,C2 (as used in the main derivation).

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which flow arrangement in a two-stream heat exchanger generally produces the largest temperature change (largest driving temperature difference and best thermal effectiveness) for the same heat-transfer area and flow rates?

**Topics:** Heat exchanger flow configurations, Log-mean temperature difference / effectiveness, Counterflow vs parallel flow

**Options:**
- Parallel flow (both fluids flow in the same direction)
- ✅ Counterflow (fluids flow in opposite directions)
- Crossflow (one fluid flows across the other)
- Shell-and-tube with single tube pass (always the best)

**Explanation:** Counterflow gives the largest local temperature difference across much of the exchanger and allows the cold fluid to approach the hot fluid inlet temperature, so for the same area and flow rates it yields the highest effectiveness (largest overall temperature change).

 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** For a simple flat wall with convective heat transfer on both sides (left convection coefficient h_L, conduction thickness L and thermal conductivity k, right convection coefficient h_R), which expression correctly gives the overall heat transfer coefficient U (per unit area) used in Q̇ = U A (T_L - T_R)?

**Topics:** Thermal resistances in series, Overall heat-transfer coefficient U, Convection and conduction resistances

**Options:**
- ✅ U = 1 / (1/h_L + L/k + 1/h_R)
- U = h_L + k/L + h_R
- U = 1 / (h_L + L/k + h_R)
- U = (h_L h_R k) / (h_L + h_R + k)

**Explanation:** Thermal resistances add in series: total resistance per unit area = 1/h_L + L/k + 1/h_R, so U is the inverse of that sum. The other forms ignore the series-resistance structure or mix units incorrectly.

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=7
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which formula gives the steady radial heat conduction through a cylindrical shell (inner radius R1, outer radius R2, length L, thermal conductivity k) between inner surface temperature T_s1 and outer surface temperature T_s2?

**Topics:** Cylindrical coordinates conduction, Radial thermal resistance, Derivation of Q̇ for pipes and shells

**Options:**
- ✅ Q̇ = 2π L k (T_s1 - T_s2) / ln(R2/R1)
- Q̇ = k A (T_s1 - T_s2) / L (with A = 2πR_avg L)
- Q̇ = 2π L k (T_s1 - T_s2) / (R2 - R1)
- Q̇ = 4π k L (T_s1 - T_s2) / ln(R2/R1)

**Explanation:** For radial conduction in a hollow cylinder the area varies with radius; integrating Fourier's law gives Q̇ = 2πkL(T_s1 - T_s2)/ln(R2/R1). The plane-wall form kAΔT/L or dividing by (R2-R1) are not correct for radial geometry.
