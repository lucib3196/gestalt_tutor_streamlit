## Derivations

### **Work for Polytropic Compression (reciprocating compressor)**
**Stub:** Expression for work input for a polytropic compression of an ideal gas: magnitude of work input W = (n/(n-1)) m R (T2 - T1) (with sign convention note); alternative forms in p–v and T forms.

**Steps:**
1. 1) Polytropic process assumption: $$p v^{n}=C\quad(\text{constant})$$.
2. 2) Work from p–v area (compression): $$W=\int_{v_1}^{v_2} p\,dv = \int_{v_1}^{v_2} C v^{-n}\,dv = \frac{C}{1-n}\left(v_2^{1-n}-v_1^{1-n}\right).$$
3. 3) Replace C by \(p_1 v_1^{n}=p_2 v_2^{n}\) and use \(C v^{1-n}=p v\) to get the standard p–v form: $$W=\frac{p_2 v_2 - p_1 v_1}{1-n} = \frac{p_1 v_1 - p_2 v_2}{n-1}.$$ (This is the integral result; sign depends on chosen convention — the shown notes take the magnitude of work input as positive.)
4. 4) Use ideal-gas relation \(p v = m R T\) so that \(p_2 v_2 - p_1 v_1 = m R (T_2 - T_1)\). Substitute into the previous expression to obtain the temperature form: $$W=\frac{m R (T_2 - T_1)}{1-n}.$$
5. 5) With the sign convention of the notes (work input positive for compression), the magnitude of work input is written as: $$W_{\text{in}}=\frac{n}{n-1}\,m R (T_2 - T_1)\quad(\text{notes' form}).$$ (Comment: this differs by sign from the direct integral; the difference is a sign convention: the integral gives work done by the gas, negative for compression; the notes present the input work magnitude.)
6. 6) Equivalent p–v algebraic rearrangement used in the notes (area decomposition) yields: $$W = \frac{n}{n-1}\,(p_2 v_2 - p_1 v_1)\qquad(\text{notes' algebraic form, same magnitude convention}).$$
7. 7) Limit n → 1 (isothermal) is singular in the polytropic formula; the correct isothermal limit (derived separately) is: $$W_{\text{iso}} = m R T \ln\frac{p_2}{p_1} = p_1 v_1 \ln\frac{p_2}{p_1}.$$
8. 8) Completeness: The main symbolic chain (integral of p dv → p–v algebra → ideal-gas substitution → temperature/p form) is present and consistent in the slides. The notes omit an explicit sign-convention statement at the integral step and do not fully derive the clearance-volume (m1−m4) mass-difference algebra used later (that is presented graphically but not expanded algebraically).

### **Isothermal compression work (special case n=1)**
**Stub:** Work for isothermal compression of an ideal gas: W = m R T ln(p2/p1) = p1 v1 ln(p2/p1).

**Steps:**
1. 1) For isothermal process, T=constant and p v = constant.
2. 2) Work (magnitude) for isothermal: $$W_{\text{iso}}=\int_{v_1}^{v_2} p\,dv = p_1 v_1 \ln\frac{v_1}{v_2} = m R T \ln\frac{p_2}{p_1}.$$
3. 3) Note from notes: since \(p_1 v_1 = p_2 v_2\), the forms \(p_1 v_1 \ln\frac{v_1}{v_2}\) and \(m R T \ln\frac{p_2}{p_1}\) are equivalent.
4. 4) Purpose: provides the lower-bound work (minimum work) for compression and is used to define 'isothermal efficiency' relative to a polytropic compression in the slides.

### **Ideal-gas mass relation and numerical mass flow**
**Stub:** Mass per cycle / mass flow from ideal-gas relation: m = p V / (R T).

**Steps:**
1. 1) Ideal-gas per-cycle mass (or instantaneous mass in a volume): $$m=\frac{p V}{R T}.$$
2. 2) In the worked numerical example the notes compute mass flow as: $$\dot m = \frac{(100\,kPa)\times(1.5/60\,m^3)}{R\,T}$$ with \(R\) per-unit-mass (notes use R=0.0815 kJ/kg·K for R-134), giving \(\dot m\approx 0.11\ \mathrm{kg/s}\).
3. 3) Purpose: supplies m used in the polytropic-work expression to obtain power (kW) for the compressor.

### **Heat transfer during polytropic compression (energy balance)**
**Stub:** Heat exchanged during compression from first law: Q = Δu + W = m c_v (T2 - T1) + W.

**Steps:**
1. 1) First law (closed system, per mass): $$Q = \Delta u + W.$$
2. 2) For ideal gas: $$\Delta u = m c_v (T_2 - T_1).$$
3. 3) Thus heat transfer during compression (note sign convention) is: $$Q = m c_v (T_2 - T_1) + W\quad(\text{use }W\text{ from polytropic expression}).$$
4. 4) In the numerical example the notes evaluate \(c_v = \dfrac{R}{\gamma - 1}\) and compute Q (kW) using computed \(\dot m\), T1 and T2 and W.

**Reference:** start_page=3 end_page=3
### **Clearance-volume / swept-volume correction for reciprocating compressor work**
**Stub:** Work expression accounting for clearance (retained mass) resulting in difference of masses m1−m4: W = (n/(n-1))(m1−m4) R T1 [ (P2/P1)^{(n-1)/n} − 1 ].

**Steps:**
1. 1) Sketch & idea: with clearance volume the effective mass compressed is reduced — graphical p–v areas show work equals area AB12 minus AB34 (notes label areas).
2. 2) Using polytropic area algebra the notes write (symbolically): $$W=\frac{n}{n-1}R T_1\left[ m_1\left(\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}-1\right) - m_4\left(\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}-1\right)\right]$$
3. 3) Factor and simplify to the compact notes' form: $$W=\frac{n}{n-1}(m_1-m_4) R T_1 \left[\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}-1\right].$$
4. 4) Purpose: gives the corrected work for a single-acting reciprocating compressor with clearance; the slides illustrate the geometric origin (reduced compressed mass) but do not fully expand the algebra for computing m1 and m4 from clearance fraction — that step is sketched graphically.

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** How does the polytropic exponent n (for compression p v^n = constant) affect the mechanical work required to compress an ideal gas between the same end pressures?

**Topics:** Polytropic process, Compression work, Isothermal vs polytropic

**Options:**
- Work required decreases as n increases; isothermal (n=1) is the maximum work case.
- Work required is independent of n for fixed end pressures.
- ✅ Work required increases as n increases; the minimum work occurs for isothermal compression (n = 1).
- Work required is minimum at n = γ (adiabatic) and larger for both lower and higher n.

**Explanation:** For a given pressure ratio the isothermal case (n=1) requires the least work. As the polytropic exponent n increases (approaching adiabatic/isentropic behavior) the work input increases, so W_polytropic > W_isothermal.

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=3
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which statement correctly describes volumetric efficiency (η_vol) of a single-acting reciprocating compressor and how clearance volume and pressure ratio affect it?

**Topics:** Volumetric efficiency, Clearance (trapped) volume, Compressor performance

**Options:**
- ✅ η_vol = (V1 - V4)/V_s; increasing clearance volume reduces η_vol, and higher discharge-to-suction pressure ratio also reduces η_vol.
- η_vol = V_s/(V1 - V4); increasing clearance volume increases η_vol and pressure ratio has no effect.
- η_vol equals the swept volume V_s; clearance volume only affects work, not η_vol.
- η_vol = (V1 + V4)/V_s; increasing clearance increases η_vol while higher pressure ratio increases η_vol.

**Explanation:** Volumetric efficiency is the fraction of swept volume actually filled with fresh suction charge: η_vol = (V1 - V4)/V_s. Larger clearance (trapped) volumes leave more residual gas and reduce the fresh intake. A higher pressure ratio increases trapped mass after discharge and so lowers η_vol.

**Reference:** start_page=4 end_page=5
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** What is the correct definition and expected numerical relation for isothermal efficiency (η_isothermal) used to compare an actual polytropic compression to the ideal isothermal compression between the same pressures?

**Topics:** Isothermal efficiency, Work comparison, Compression performance metric

**Options:**
- η_isothermal = W_poly / W_iso; it is greater than 1 because polytropic work is larger than isothermal work.
- ✅ η_isothermal = W_iso / W_poly; it is less than 1 because isothermal work is the theoretical minimum.
- η_isothermal = (W_iso - W_poly)/W_poly; it can be negative for real compressors.
- η_isothermal = 1 - (W_iso/W_poly); it equals zero for an ideal isothermal compressor.

**Explanation:** Isothermal efficiency is defined as the ratio of the ideal (minimum) isothermal work to the actual polytropic work: η_isothermal = W_iso / W_polytropic. Since W_iso < W_poly for the same pressure ratio, this efficiency is a number less than 1 (often expressed as a percentage).
