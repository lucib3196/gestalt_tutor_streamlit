## Internal Pipe Flow: Velocity Profiles, Friction Factor, Two-Layer Model and Heat Transfer Analogy

**Lecture Type:** mixed

### Summary
The lecture examines internal flow in circular pipes, contrasting laminar and turbulent velocity profiles and deriving relationships for mean velocity, wall shear and pressure loss. It develops a two-layer model consisting of a viscous sublayer and a turbulent core to estimate the friction factor's dependence on Reynolds number, and uses the Chilton–Colburn analogy to connect friction to convective heat transfer. The lecture closes with an introduction to the integral momentum method for boundary layers on a flat plate.

## Derivations

### **Friction factor for turbulent pipe flow (1/7 power law) and resulting Nu correlation**
**Stub:** Derive f_D ∝ Re^{-1/4} from a 1/7 power-law velocity profile and obtain Cf and Nu: $$f_D=0.326\,\mathrm{Re}^{-1/4},\quad C_f=\frac{f_D}{4}=0.082\,\mathrm{Re}^{-1/4},\quad Nu=0.04\,\mathrm{Re}^{3/4}\,Pr^{1/3}$$

**Steps:**
1. Assume the turbulent (1/7) power-law velocity profile in a pipe (radius R, centreline velocity u_m):
$$u(r)=u_m\left(\frac{R-r}{R}\right)^{1/7}\quad\text{or}\quad \frac{u}{u_m}=\left(\frac{y}{\delta}\right)^{1/7},\;\delta\approx R$$
2. Compute volumetric flow Q by integrating the profile over the cross-section:
$$Q=\int_0^R u(r)\,2\pi r\,dr$$
3. Change variable to simplify the integral: let \(t=\frac{R-r}{R}\) so \(r=R(1-t),\;dr=-R\,dt\). The integral becomes
$$Q=2\pi R^2 u_m\int_{0}^{1} t^{1/7}(1-t)\,dt$$
4. Evaluate the Beta-type integral:
$$\int_0^1 t^{1/7}(1-t)\,dt=\frac{7}{8}-\frac{7}{15}=\frac{49}{120}$$
5. Hence
$$Q=2\pi R^2 u_m\frac{49}{120}=\frac{98}{120}u_m\,\pi R^2$$
so the cross-section-averaged velocity is
$$\bar u=\frac{Q}{\pi R^2}=\frac{98}{120}\,u_m$$
6. Define the friction (shear) velocity and relate it to pipe friction factor:
$$\tau_w=\rho u_*^2,\qquad f_D=8\left(\frac{u_*}{\bar u}\right)^2,\qquad C_f=2\left(\frac{u_*}{\bar u}\right)^2=\frac{f_D}{4}$$
7. Introduce a two-layer model (laminar viscous sublayer of thickness \(\delta_{LS}\) and an outer turbulent core). Model the laminar sublayer thickness as
$$\delta_{LS}=\beta\frac{\nu}{u_*}\quad(\beta\text{ is an }O(1)\text{ constant})$$and apply a matching condition at the sublayer edge: the velocity from the power-law at \(y=\delta_{LS}\) equals the velocity scale in the sublayer, taken as \(\beta u_*\):
$$\beta u_*\;=\;u(\delta_{LS})\;=\;u_m\left(\frac{\delta_{LS}}{R}\right)^{1/7}$$
8. Substitute \(\delta_{LS}=\beta\nu/u_*\) into the matching condition and rearrange to isolate \((u_*/u_m)\):
$$\beta u_* = u_m\left(\frac{\beta\nu}{u_* R}\right)^{1/7}$$
Raise both sides to the 7th power and simplify to obtain
$$\beta^{6}\left(\frac{u_*}{u_m}\right)^{8}=\frac{\nu}{R u_m}$$
so
$$\frac{u_*}{u_m}=\left[\beta^{-6}\frac{\nu}{R u_m}\right]^{1/8}$$
9. Convert to the mean velocity scale using \(u_m=\dfrac{120}{98}\,\bar u\) (from step 5). Substitution and algebra give the scaling (collecting constants into one prefactor):
$$\left(\frac{u_*}{\bar u}\right)^2\propto\left(\frac{\nu}{D\,\bar u}\right)^{1/4}=\mathrm{Re}^{-1/4},\quad D=2R$$
10. Therefore the Darcy friction factor becomes
$$f_D=8\left(\frac{u_*}{\bar u}\right)^2 = C\;\mathrm{Re}^{-1/4}$$
Evaluate the constant using the algebraic prefactors and the empirical choice \(\beta\approx 12\) (given in the notes) to obtain the numeric correlation
$$f_D\approx 0.326\;\mathrm{Re}^{-1/4}$$
11. From that result
$$C_f=\frac{f_D}{4}\approx 0.082\;\mathrm{Re}^{-1/4}$$
12. Use the Chilton–Colburn/Colburn-type analogy to get heat-transfer (noting the manipulations in the notes):
$$Nu\approx 0.04\;\mathrm{Re}^{3/4}\;Pr^{1/3},\qquad 4000\lesssim\mathrm{Re}\lesssim 2\times10^4$$
13. Completeness / caveats: the slides provide a mostly complete algebraic chain from the 1/7 profile and two-layer matching to the Re^{-1/4} scaling and numerical prefactor; however the step where experimental/empirical constant \(\beta\) is introduced (and its value \(\beta\approx12\)) is empirical (not derived) and the derivation does not show connection to the logarithmic law (no derivation of \(\beta\) from first principles).

### **Mean (bulk) velocity from the 1/7 power-law profile (detailed integration)**
**Stub:** Compute \(\bar u\) from \(u(r)=u_m\left(\dfrac{R-r}{R}\right)^{1/7}\) giving \(\bar u=\dfrac{98}{120}u_m\).

**Steps:**
1. Start: \(u(r)=u_m\left(\dfrac{R-r}{R}\right)^{1/7}\).
2. Volumetric flow: \(Q=\int_0^R u(r)\,2\pi r\,dr\).
3. Substitute \(t=(R-r)/R\) to get \(Q=2\pi R^2 u_m\int_0^1 t^{1/7}(1-t)\,dt\).
4. Evaluate the integral: \(\int_0^1 t^{1/7}(1-t)\,dt=49/120\).
5. Therefore \(Q=(98/120)u_m\pi R^2\) and \(\bar u=Q/(\pi R^2)=98/120\,u_m\).

### **Laminar pipe flow (parabolic) — mean velocity and friction factor**
**Stub:** Parabolic velocity profile for laminar (Hagen–Poiseuille) flow: \(u(r)=u_m(1-r^2/R^2)\) gives \(\bar u=u_m/2\) and \(f_D=64/\mathrm{Re}\).

**Steps:**
1. Laminar profile written in notes: \(u= u_m\left(1-\dfrac{r^2}{R^2}\right)\).
2. From integration one finds \(\bar u=\dfrac{u_m}{2}\).
3. Classical laminar friction factor: \(f_D=\dfrac{64}{\mathrm{Re}}\) (not derived in detail on these slides but stated).

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=1
### **Shear stress at the wall and consequence for the power-law profile**
**Stub:** Wall shear: \(\tau_w=-\mu\dfrac{du}{dy}\big|_{y=0}=\rho u_*^2\); pure power-law gives infinite gradient at the wall (necessitating a viscous sublayer).

**Steps:**
1. General relation: \(\tau_w=-\mu\dfrac{du}{dy}\Big|_{y=0}=\rho u_*^2\).
2. Using the power-law outer profile \(u\sim y^{1/7}\) gives \(du/dy|_{y\to0}\to\infty\) (singularity), so a thin viscous sublayer must exist near the wall — motivating the two-layer model.

### **Two-layer matching and laminar sublayer thickness scaling**
**Stub:** Relate \(\delta_{LS}=\beta\nu/u_*
ight)\) and matching velocity \(u(\delta_{LS})=\beta u_*\) to connect u_* and u_m.

**Steps:**
1. Assume laminar sublayer thickness scaling: \(\delta_{LS}=\beta\dfrac{\nu}{u_*}\).
2. Matching condition (velocity continuity at interface): \(u(\delta_{LS})=u_m(\delta_{LS}/R)^{1/7}=\beta u_*\).
3. Algebra (see main derivation) leads to
$$\left(\frac{u_*}{u_m}\right)=\left[\beta^{-6}\frac{\nu}{R u_m}\right]^{1/8}$$which after substitution of \(u_m\) by \(\bar u\) yields the scaling for \(u_*/\bar u\) used to get \(f_D\propto\mathrm{Re}^{-1/4}\).

### **Chilton–Colburn (Colburn) analogy for heat transfer (applied result)**
**Stub:** Use friction results to estimate Nu via a Colburn-type analogy; final slide gives $$Nu\approx 0.04\,Re^{3/4}\,Pr^{1/3}$$ for the stated Re range.

**Steps:**
1. Start from the Chilton–Colburn idea (notes): relate friction and thermal boundary-layer thicknesses: \(\dfrac{C_f}{2}Re\sim Nu\,\dfrac{\delta}{\delta_T}\) (manipulations in notes).
2. With the derived \(C_f\propto Re^{-1/4}\) and an assumed thermal sublayer scaling, the notes conclude
$$Nu\approx 0.04\,Re^{3/4}\,Pr^{1/3}\quad(4000<Re<2\times10^4)$$

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which of the following correctly describes fully developed laminar flow in a circular pipe?

**Topics:** Laminar flow, Velocity profile, Friction factor

**Options:**
- ✅ Parabolic velocity profile u(r)=um(1−r^2/R^2); mean velocity u¯ = um/2; friction factor fD = 64/Re
- Flat (plug) velocity profile; mean velocity u¯ = um; friction factor fD = 64/Re
- Parabolic profile; mean velocity u¯ = um/2; friction factor fD ≈ 0.326 Re^(−1/4)
- Turbulent 1/7 power-law profile applies and gives fD = 64/Re

**Explanation:** Fully developed laminar pipe flow has a parabolic profile u=um(1−r^2/R^2). The cross‑sectional average is u¯=um/2 and the Darcy friction factor scales as fD=64/Re.

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=1
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** In the two‑layer model for turbulent pipe flow, which expression gives the estimated thickness of the viscous (laminar) sublayer δLS?

**Topics:** Turbulent flow, Laminar sublayer, Friction velocity

**Options:**
- ✅ δLS = β · ν / u*  (β is a constant, u* is the friction velocity)
- δLS = β · u* / ν
- δLS ∝ D (pipe diameter) and independent of u*
- δLS = β · ν / u¯  (uses bulk mean velocity u¯ instead of u*)

**Explanation:** Matching the linear laminar sublayer velocity to the turbulent core gives δLS scaling with the kinematic viscosity divided by the friction velocity: δLS ≈ βν/u*.

**Reference:** start_page=4 end_page=5
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Using the Chilton–Colburn analogy and the turbulent correlation derived in the lecture for internal flow (4000 < Re < 20,000), which is the correct Nusselt number correlation for forced convection?

**Topics:** Heat transfer, Chilton–Colburn analogy, Nusselt correlation

**Options:**
- ✅ Nu = 0.04 · Re^(3/4) · Pr^(1/3)
- Nu = 0.326 · Re^(−1/4)
- Nu = 0.082 · Re^(−1/4) · Pr^(1/3)
- Nu = 64 / Re

**Explanation:** Applying the Chilton–Colburn analogy with the turbulent friction correlation leads to Nu ∝ Re^(3/4) Pr^(1/3); the lecture gives Nu ≈ 0.04 Re^(3/4) Pr^(1/3) for the stated Re range.
