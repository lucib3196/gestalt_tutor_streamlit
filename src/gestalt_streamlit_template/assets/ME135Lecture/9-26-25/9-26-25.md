## Thermodynamics of Refrigeration and Heat Pumps

**Lecture Type:** mixed

### Summary
Introduction to the thermodynamic principles of refrigeration and heat-pump cycles. The lecture describes the components and energy flows of a refrigeration loop, defines coefficient(s) of performance for refrigerators and heat pumps and discusses the Carnot (ideal) performance limit. It also reviews key thermodynamic properties (intensive vs extensive, specific properties), state vs process distinctions, enthalpy and entropy concepts, work as area under a P–V path, and the ideal‑gas relation as a useful equation of state.

### Core Topics
- Vapor‑compression refrigeration cycle components (compressor, condenser, expansion/evaporator, turbine/expander)
- Heat transfers and work flows in refrigeration cycles
- Coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigerators and heat pumps
- Carnot (ideal) COP as a theoretical limit
- Intensive vs extensive properties and specific properties (v, h, u, s)
- State vs process; path dependence of heat and work
- Work as area under a P–V curve (PdV work)
- Enthalpy and entropy concepts and their roles in energy balances
- Ideal‑gas equation of state (relation among P, V, T, and mass/moles)

## Derivations

### **COP (Carnot) for Refrigerator / Heat Pump**
**Stub:** Derive coefficient of performance (COP) for a reversible (Carnot) refrigerator and heat pump: $$\text{COP}_{\text{ref}} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c},\quad \text{COP}_{\text{hp}} = \frac{T_h}{T_h - T_c}$$

**Steps:**
1. 1) Energy (first-law) balance for the refrigeration cycle (sign convention as in notes): $$Q_H = Q_C + W_{\text{net}}$$ where $Q_H$ is heat rejected to the hot reservoir ($T_H$), $Q_C$ is heat extracted from cold reservoir ($T_C$), and $W_{\text{net}}$ is net work input (compressor work minus turbine output).
2. 2) Definition of coefficient of performance (COP) for a refrigerator: $$\text{COP}_{\text{ref}} = \frac{Q_C}{W_{\text{net}}}$$ and for a heat pump: $$\text{COP}_{\text{hp}} = \frac{Q_H}{W_{\text{net}}}.$$
3. 3) For a reversible (Carnot) cycle, apply the 2nd law (Carnot relation): $$\frac{Q_C}{T_C} = \frac{Q_H}{T_H}\;\Rightarrow\; Q_H = Q_C\frac{T_H}{T_C}.$$ (This relation is stated on the slides for the ideal Carnot cycle.)
4. 4) Express $W_{\text{net}}$ using (1): $$W_{\text{net}} = Q_H - Q_C = Q_C\left(\frac{T_H}{T_C} - 1\right).$$
5. 5) Substitute into the refrigerator COP: $$\text{COP}_{\text{ref}} = \frac{Q_C}{Q_C\left(\frac{T_H}{T_C} - 1\right)} = \frac{1}{\frac{T_H}{T_C} - 1} = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C}.$$
6. 6) Similarly, heat-pump COP: $$\text{COP}_{\text{hp}} = \frac{Q_H}{W_{\text{net}}} = \frac{Q_C\frac{T_H}{T_C}}{Q_C\left(\frac{T_H}{T_C} - 1\right)} = \frac{T_H}{T_H - T_C}.$$
7. Completeness: The derivation on slides 1–2 is complete for the reversible (Carnot) case; the Carnot relation $Q_C/T_C=Q_H/T_H$ is stated (no detailed proof of that relation is shown).

### **Carnot relation (stated) from 2nd Law**
**Stub:** Statement used for ideal (Carnot) reversible cycle: $$\frac{Q_C}{T_C} = \frac{Q_H}{T_H}$$

**Steps:**
1. 1) The slides state the Carnot (reversible) relation without detailed derivation: for a reversible cycle the net entropy change is zero, so the heat exchanges divided by their reservoir temperatures are equal in magnitude: $$\Delta S_{\text{cycle}} = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{Q_H}{T_H} - \frac{Q_C}{T_C} = 0.$$
2. 2) Rearranged form: $$\frac{Q_C}{T_C} = \frac{Q_H}{T_H}.$$
3. Completeness: Stated on page 2; derivation from the integral form of the 2nd law (or Clausius theorem) is not shown on the slides.

**Reference:** start_page=2 end_page=2
### **Specific enthalpy relation**
**Stub:** Relate specific enthalpy to internal energy and pressure–volume work: $$h = u + Pv$$

**Steps:**
1. 1) Total enthalpy definition for a system: $$H = U + PV.$$
2. 2) Divide by mass $m$ to obtain specific properties: $$h = \frac{H}{m} = \frac{U}{m} + \frac{PV}{m} = u + Pv.$$
3. Completeness: Complete and straightforward algebraic manipulation shown on page 4.

**Reference:** start_page=4 end_page=4
### **Entropy differential and change**
**Stub:** Differential relation and definition for entropy in reversible processes: $$ds = \frac{\delta Q_{\text{rev}}}{T},\quad \Delta s = \int \frac{\delta Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}$$

**Steps:**
1. 1) Slides give the differential form for entropy for a reversible process: $$ds = \frac{\delta Q}{T}.$$
2. 2) Integrating between two states: $$\Delta s = \int \frac{\delta Q}{T}.$$
3. Purpose: This relation underpins the Carnot relation and the statement of zero net entropy change for a reversible cycle (used in main derivation).
4. Completeness: Statement shown on page 4; formal derivation from the Clausius inequality not shown.

**Reference:** start_page=4 end_page=4
### **Ideal gas equation (molar → mass form)**
**Stub:** Convert PV = n\bar{R}T to the mass-based form PV = mRT

**Steps:**
1. 1) Start with the molar form: $$PV = n\bar{R}T,\quad n=\frac{m}{M}\text{ (number of moles)}$$ where $\bar{R}$ is the universal gas constant and $M$ is molar mass.
2. 2) Substitute $n$: $$PV = \frac{m}{M}\bar{R}T = m\left(\frac{\bar{R}}{M}\right)T.$$
3. 3) Define the specific gas constant $R = \bar{R}/M$ to get: $$PV = mRT.$$
4. Purpose: Provides the equation of state used in thermodynamic analyses of working fluids (relevant to compressor/turbine behavior in the cycle).
5. Completeness: Complete algebraic conversion shown on page 4.

**Reference:** start_page=4 end_page=4
### **Work for a closed system (p–v work)**
**Stub:** Expression for boundary work in a quasi-static closed system: $$W = \int P\,dV$$

**Steps:**
1. 1) The slides show the area-under-curve interpretation on a P–V diagram: work done by/on the system for a quasi-static process is the integral of pressure over volume change: $$W = \int P\,dV.$$
2. 2) Graphical illustration on page 3 highlights how different paths between the same end states yield different work (area under respective P–V paths).
3. Purpose: Emphasizes that work is path-dependent (unlike state functions) and is used in first-law balances for the cycle.
4. Completeness: Statement and sketch are shown on page 3 (no explicit evaluation of the integral for a specific process).

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** For an ideal Carnot refrigerator operating between a cold reservoir at temperature Tc and a hot reservoir at temperature Th (absolute), which expression gives the coefficient of performance (COP) for cooling mode?

**Topics:** Carnot cycle / ideal refrigerator, Coefficient of Performance (COP), Thermodynamic temperature relations (Qc/Tc = Qh/Th)

**Options:**
- ✅ COP = Tc / (Th − Tc)
- COP = Th / (Th − Tc)
- COP = (Th − Tc) / Tc
- COP = Tc / Th

**Explanation:** For a Carnot refrigerator COP = Qc / Wnet and using Qc/Tc = Qh/Th with Wnet = Qh − Qc, substitution yields COP = Tc / (Th − Tc).

**Reference:** start_page=2 end_page=2
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which relation correctly expresses specific enthalpy h in terms of specific internal energy u and specific volume v?

**Topics:** Enthalpy definition, Specific (intensive) properties, Relation H = U + PV (per unit mass)

**Options:**
- ✅ h = u + P v
- h = U + P V
- h = H · m
- h = u − P v

**Explanation:** Enthalpy per unit mass h = H/m and H = U + PV; dividing by mass gives h = u + Pv (u = U/m, v = V/m).

**Reference:** start_page=4 end_page=4
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which of the following quantities is NOT a state property (i.e., it depends on the path of the process)?

**Topics:** State vs process variables, Path functions (heat and work), Thermodynamic fundamentals

**Options:**
- Pressure (P)
- Temperature (T)
- Entropy (S)
- ✅ Heat (Q)

**Explanation:** Pressure, temperature and entropy are state properties (depend only on the state). Heat (and work) are path-dependent process quantities, not state functions.
