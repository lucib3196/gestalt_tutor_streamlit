The lecture defines humidity ratio and relative humidity, presents practical enthalpy and specific‑volume approximations for moist air, and shows how to set up mass and energy balances for air–water contact processes. It explains the concept of adiabatic saturation (wet‑bulb) temperature and works through numerical examples to compute humidity, enthalpy, specific volume, and system cooling requirements including use of COP.",
