## Derivations

### **Specific enthalpy of moist air (per kg dry air)**
**Stub:** Derive specific enthalpy h (kJ/kg dry air) of moist air: h = h_a + ω h_v → h(T) ≈ c_{pa} T + ω h_g(T) and refined form h(T)=c_{pa}T+ω[h_f(T_{dp})+h_{fg}(T_{dp})+c_{ps}(T-T_{dp})].

**Steps:**
1. Total enthalpy of a moist-air mixture: $$H = H_a + H_v = m_a h_a + m_v h_v$$ (where subscript a = dry air, v = water vapor).
2. Specific enthalpy per unit dry air (divide by \(m_a\)): $$h \equiv \frac{H}{m_a} = h_a + \frac{m_v}{m_a} h_v = h_a + \omega h_v\quad\text{with}\ \omega\equiv\frac{m_v}{m_a}.$$
3. Express dry-air enthalpy approximately as a function of temperature: $$h_a \approx c_{pa}T.$$ Thus $$h = c_{pa}T + \omega\,h_v(T).$$
4. Approximate vapor enthalpy by saturated vapor enthalpy (common in psychrometrics): $$h_v(T) \approx h_g(T)\quad\Rightarrow\quad h(T) \approx c_{pa}T + \omega\,h_g(T).$$
5. More accurate decomposition using dew point \(T_{dp}\): vapor enthalpy at actual T can be written by reference to liquid at dew point and sensible heating of vapor: $$h_v(T) = h_f(T_{dp}) + h_{fg}(T_{dp}) + c_{ps}(T - T_{dp}).$$
6. Substitute into mixture enthalpy: $$h(T)=c_{pa}T + \omega\big[ h_f(T_{dp}) + h_{fg}(T_{dp}) + c_{ps}(T-T_{dp})\big].$$ (This separates liquid enthalpy at dew point, latent heat at dew point, and vapor sensible term.)
7. Group constants / approximate numerical values used in lecture notes: $$h_f(T_{dp})+h_{fg}(T_{dp})\approx 2500\ \mathrm{kJ/kg},\quad c_{ps}\approx 1.9\ \mathrm{kJ/(kg\,K)},\quad c_{pa}\approx 1.005\ \mathrm{kJ/(kg\,K)}.$$
8. Thus the working approximate formula given: $$\boxed{\;h(T)\approx 1.005\,T + \omega\,[2500 + 1.9\,T]\;}\quad(\text{kJ/kg dry air, }T\text{ in }^{\circ}\mathrm{C}).$$
9. Notes on approximations / completeness: the derivation is complete for the intended psychrometric approximation but relies on approximations (\(h_v\approx h_g\), numeric constants, and using latent heat evaluated at dew point). If higher accuracy is needed one must use tabulated \(h_g(T)\) or include exact reference-state integrals and the explicit dew-point evaluation.

### **Humidity ratio and relative humidity relations**
**Stub:** Define humidity ratio \(\omega\) and relative humidity \(\phi\): \(\omega=0.622\,p_v/(p-p_v)\), \(\phi=p_v/p_{v,sat}\).

**Steps:**
1. Relative humidity definition: $$\boxed{\;\phi\equiv\frac{p_v}{p_{v,\text{sat}}(T)}\;}\quad(\text{page 1}).$$
2. Vapor partial pressure from RH: $$p_v = \phi\,p_{v,\text{sat}}(T).$$
3. Humidity ratio (mass of vapor per unit mass dry air) from ideal-gas relations: $$\boxed{\;\omega\equiv\frac{m_v}{m_a} = 0.622\frac{p_v}{p - p_v}\;}$$ (0.622 = R_v/R_a).

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=1
### **Specific volume of moist air (per kg dry air)**
**Stub:** Derive specific volume per kg dry air v = V/m_a in terms of T, pressures and humidity ratio: v = T(1+ω)/(p_a/R_a + p_v/R_v) (ideal-gas based).

**Steps:**
1. Total mass: $$m = m_a + m_v = m_a(1+\omega).$$
2. Use ideal-gas for components: $$m_a = \frac{p_a V}{R_a T},\quad m_v = \frac{p_v V}{R_v T}.$$
3. Rearrange to get specific volume per kg dry air \(v\equiv V/m_a\): $$v = \frac{V}{m_a} = \frac{T(1+\omega)}{\dfrac{p_a}{R_a} + \dfrac{p_v}{R_v}}.$$ (boxed form on page 3).

### **Heat removed during cooling (sensible + condensation) per kg dry air**
**Stub:** Expression for heat removed Q for air cooled from state 1 to 2 including possible condensation: e.g. Q = m_a[h_1 - h_2] and when condensate forms include condensate sensible term leading to Q = m_a[ h_1 - h_2 - (\omega_1-\omega_2)c_p T ] (per lecture notes).

**Steps:**
1. Basic energy change per kg dry air (no mass exchange): $$Q = h_1 - h_2\quad(\text{kJ per kg dry air}).$$
2. When condensation occurs, latent mass leaves as condensate and its cooling to sink temperature must be accounted: lecture develops form $$Q = \dot m_a h_1 - \dot m_a h_2 - \dot m_{cond} c_p T_{cond}\;\Rightarrow\; Q = \dot m_a\big[ h_1 - h_2 - (\omega_1-\omega_2)c_p T\big].$$
3. Used in worked examples on pages 4--5 to compute numeric heat removed for air cooled to 30°C and 20°C (including condensate mass and latent heat contributions).

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Air at 40°C and 50% relative humidity is cooled to 30°C. If the air's dew point is below 30°C, which statement is correct?

**Topics:** Dew point and condensation, Humidity ratio, Relative humidity change with temperature

**Options:**
- Condensation occurs and the humidity ratio decreases.
- ✅ No condensation occurs; the humidity ratio remains the same and the relative humidity increases.
- No condensation occurs; the humidity ratio remains the same but the relative humidity decreases.
- Condensation occurs but the relative humidity stays constant.

**Explanation:** If the final temperature stays above the dew point, no water condenses so the humidity ratio (mass of vapor per kg dry air) is constant. Because saturation vapour pressure falls with temperature, the same vapour pressure corresponds to a higher relative humidity at the lower temperature.

 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which approximate expression gives the specific enthalpy of moist air per kg of dry air?

**Topics:** Specific enthalpy of moist air, Enthalpy contributions from dry air and vapor, Use of saturated vapour enthalpy approximation

**Options:**
- ✅ h = c_pa · T + ω · h_g(T)  (where ω is humidity ratio and h_g is vapor (gas) enthalpy)
- h = c_pa · T + ω · c_pv · T  (only sensible part of vapour included)
- h = c_pa · T + h_v(T)  (vapour enthalpy per kg dry air without multiplying by ω)
- h = c_pa · T + ω · h_f(T)  (using liquid water enthalpy instead of vapour)

**Explanation:** Per kg dry air, total enthalpy ≈ enthalpy of dry air (c_pa·T) plus the enthalpy of the water vapour present, which is ω times the vapour enthalpy. In practice hv(T) is often approximated by hg(T) (vapour/gas enthalpy).

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=2
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** When humid air is cooled below its dew point and condensation occurs, the total heat removed per kg dry air must include which terms?

**Topics:** Heat balance during cooling with condensation, Sensible vs latent heat, Accounting for condensate cooling

**Options:**
- Only the sensible cooling of the dry air (c_pa·ΔT).
- ✅ Sensible cooling of the dry air, the latent heat released by the condensed vapour ((ω1−ω2)·h_fg), and the sensible cooling of the condensate to the final temperature.
- Only the latent heat associated with the amount condensed; sensible cooling is negligible.
- Only the change in vapour enthalpy per kg of vapour (h_v(T1)−h_v(T2)) without considering dry air.

**Explanation:** When condensation occurs you must account for sensible cooling of the dry air, the latent heat released by the portion of vapour that condenses (proportional to ω1−ω2), and the sensible cooling of the liquid condensate from condensation temperature to the final temperature. All these contributions appear in the total heat removed per kg dry air.
