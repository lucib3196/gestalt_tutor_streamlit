## Introduction to Transport Phenomena: Heat, Momentum and Mass Transfer

**Lecture Type:** mixed

### Summary
This lecture introduces the basic mechanisms of transport: molecular (diffusive) and convective transfer of heat, momentum, and mass. It presents the phenomenological laws that relate fluxes to gradients (heat conduction, viscous momentum transport, and mass diffusion), defines relevant transport properties (thermal diffusivity, kinematic viscosity, diffusion coefficient), and contrasts molecular fluxes with bulk convective transport. The lecture also introduces nondimensional numbers used to compare transport rates.

## Derivations

### **Unified Constitutive Laws for Transport (Fourier, Newtonian Viscosity, Fick)**
**Stub:** Establish flux expressions of the form $$\text{flux} = -\;(\text{transport coefficient})\;\nabla(\text{transported quantity})$$ and define transport coefficients (thermal diffusivity, kinematic viscosity, mass diffusivity).

**Steps:**
1. Heat conduction — finite slab picture: $$\dot{Q} = k A \frac{T_1 - T_2}{y}.$$ Define area flux $$q''=\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} = -k\frac{T_2- T_1}{y}.$$ In the differential limit (y→0) this becomes Fourier's law: $$q'' = -k\frac{dT}{dy}.$$
2. Expressing energy in terms of enthalpy per unit volume: the slides write the flux as (per area) proportional to the gradient of \(\rho c_p T\): $$q'' = -\frac{k}{\rho c_p}\frac{d(\rho c_p T)}{dy}.$$ Define thermal diffusivity $$\alpha \triangleq \frac{k}{\rho c_p},$$ so the form is $$q'' = -\alpha\frac{d(\rho c_p T)}{dy}\quad\text{(energy flux form used on slides).}$$
3. Momentum (viscous shear) — simple Couette picture: starting from a force required to move the plate, $$F = \mu\frac{V}{y}A \;\Rightarrow\; \frac{F}{A}=\mu\frac{V}{y}.$$ Identify shear stress $$\tau = \mu\frac{V}{y}$$ and in the differential limit $$\tau = -\mu\frac{du}{dy}\;\;\text{(Newtonian viscous law as written on slides).}$$
4. Introduce kinematic viscosity \(\nu\): $$\nu \triangleq \frac{\mu}{\rho}$$ and (as shown on slides) express shear in a density-weighted gradient form: $$\tau = -\nu\frac{d(\rho u)}{dy} \quad\text{(slide formulation linking momentum per unit volume).}$$
5. Mass transfer (diffusion) — two-plate concentration difference: mass flow of A $$\dot{m}_A = D_{AB}\frac{c_{A1}-c_{A2}}{y}A.$$ Define mass flux (per area) $$j_A\equiv\frac{\dot{m}_A}{A}$$ and in differential form Fick's law: $$j_A = -D_{AB}\frac{dc_A}{dy}.$$
6. General unified statement (slide boxed idea): Fluxes are proportional to a negative gradient of the transported quantity: $$\boxed{\;\text{flux} = -\;\mathcal{D}\;\frac{d(\text{quantity})}{dy}\;}$$ where \(\mathcal{D}\) is the appropriate transport coefficient (\(k\) for heat, \(\mu\) or \(\nu\) for momentum in the slide formulations, \(D_{AB}\) for mass).
7. Convective (advective) transport (slides): convective energy flux per area: $$\frac{\dot{E}}{A}=(\rho c_p T)\,v.$$ Convective mass flux: $$j_{A,conv} = c_A\,v.$$ Convective momentum (momentum flux) per area: $$\tau_{conv}=\frac{\dot{M}}{A}=\rho v^2.$$ These are the advective counterparts (no gradient; proportional to transported quantity times velocity).
8. Dimension and coefficient definitions emphasized on slides: transport coefficients have units \(\mathrm{m^2/s}\) when expressed as diffusivities: $$[\alpha]=[\nu]=[D_{AB}]=\mathrm{m^2/s}.$$
9. Dimensionless groups (slides): Prandtl and Schmidt numbers relate momentum diffusivity to thermal/mass diffusivity: $$\mathrm{Pr}\triangleq\frac{\nu}{\alpha},\qquad\mathrm{Sc}\triangleq\frac{\nu}{D_{AB}}.$$
10. Completeness: The slides present a compact, consistent set of constitutive relations (Fourier, Newtonian viscous law, Fick) and their unification into the general flux = -D * gradient form plus convective counterparts and dimensionless numbers. Missing from the slides is a rigorous derivation from first principles (e.g., from Boltzmann/kinetic theory or from detailed conservation + closure step); the shown derivation is the constitutive/phenomenological statement rather than a microscopic derivation.

### **Fourier's Law (Heat Conduction) — Slide Derivation**
**Stub:** From finite slab heat conduction to differential Fourier law and definition of thermal diffusivity.

**Steps:**
1. Finite form: $$\dot{Q}=kA\frac{T_1-T_2}{y},\qquad q''=\frac{\dot{Q}}{A}=-k\frac{T_2-T_1}{y}.$$
2. Differential form: $$q''=-k\frac{dT}{dy}.$$
3. Alternative energy-form used on slides: $$q''=-\frac{k}{\rho c_p}\frac{d(\rho c_p T)}{dy} = -\alpha\frac{d(\rho c_p T)}{dy},\quad \alpha=\frac{k}{\rho c_p}.$$

### **Newtonian Viscous Stress (Momentum Transport)**
**Stub:** Shear stress from plate motion to Newtonian relation and introduction of kinematic viscosity.

**Steps:**
1. Finite Couette estimate: $$F=\mu\frac{V}{y}A\Rightarrow\tau=\frac{F}{A}=\mu\frac{V}{y}.$$
2. Differential form (slide sign convention): $$\tau=-\mu\frac{du}{dy}.$$
3. Using \(\nu=\mu/\rho\) the slides express a density-weighted form: $$\tau=-\nu\frac{d(\rho u)}{dy}.$$

### **Convective Transport Expressions**
**Stub:** Fluxes due to bulk motion (convective/advective transport) for energy, mass and momentum.

**Steps:**
1. Convective energy flux per area (slides): $$\frac{\dot{E}}{A}=(\rho c_p T)\,v.$$
2. Convective mass flux: $$j_{A,conv}=c_A\,v.$$
3. Convective momentum flux (ram pressure-like): $$\tau_{conv}=\frac{\dot{M}}{A}=\rho v^2.$$
4. These contrast with diffusive fluxes (which depend on gradients) and are shown on page 5.

### **Dimensionless Numbers: Prandtl and Schmidt**
**Stub:** Definitions linking kinematic viscosity to thermal and mass diffusivities.

**Steps:**
1. Prandtl number (momentum vs. thermal diffusivity): $$\mathrm{Pr}=\frac{\nu}{\alpha},\quad\alpha=\frac{k}{\rho c_p}.$$
2. Schmidt number (momentum vs. mass diffusivity): $$\mathrm{Sc}=\frac{\nu}{D_{AB}}.$$
3. Slides emphasize units and that these ratios control relative thicknesses of momentum, thermal and concentration boundary layers (page 4).

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which expression correctly gives the conductive heat flux per unit area (Fourier's law) in the lecture notes?

**Topics:** Heat conduction, Fourier's law, Thermal diffusivity

**Options:**
- ✅ q'' = -k dT/dy
- q'' = -k d(ρ c_p T)/dy
- q'' = -α dT/dy
- q'' = ρ c_p T · v (convective form)

**Explanation:** Fourier's law for conduction is q'' = -k dT/dy. The form with ρc_pT is the energy per unit volume whose gradient appears in transient/energy equations; α (thermal diffusivity) is k/(ρc_p) and not the conductive flux coefficient; ρc_pT·v is convective heat transport, not conduction.

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=2
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** What is the correct definition of kinematic viscosity ν from the lecture?

**Topics:** Momentum transfer, Viscosity, Kinematic viscosity

**Options:**
- ✅ ν = μ / ρ
- ν = μ · ρ
- ν = μ / (ρ c_p)
- ν = D_AB / μ

**Explanation:** Kinematic viscosity ν is defined as dynamic viscosity μ divided by density ρ (ν = μ/ρ). The other forms are incorrect: μ/(ρ c_p) is not ν, and D_AB/μ has different physical meaning and units.

**Reference:** start_page=2 end_page=3
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which dimensionless number compares momentum diffusivity to mass diffusivity as given in the notes?

**Topics:** Dimensionless numbers, Mass transfer, Diffusivities

**Options:**
- ✅ Schmidt number Sc = ν / D_AB
- Prandtl number Pr = ν / α
- Peclet number Pe = Re · Pr
- Reynolds number Re = ρVL/μ

**Explanation:** The Schmidt number Sc = ν / D_AB compares momentum diffusivity (ν) to mass diffusivity (D_AB). Prandtl compares momentum to thermal diffusivity; Peclet and Reynolds are different dimensionless groups.
