    "lecture_summary": "This lecture introduces the basic mechanisms of transport: molecular (diffusive) and convective transfer of heat, momentum, and mass. It presents the phenomenological laws that relate fluxes to gradients (heat conduction, viscous momentum transport, and mass diffusion), defines relevant transport properties (thermal diffusivity, kinematic viscosity, diffusion coefficient), and contrasts molecular fluxes with bulk convective transport. The lecture also introduces nondimensional numbers used to compare transport rates.",
