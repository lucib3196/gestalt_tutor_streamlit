    "lecture_summary": "Introduction to the properties of air–vapor mixtures using the ideal gas model. The lecture covers how total pressure of a mixture arises from partial pressures (Dalton’s law), how mole fraction relates to partial pressure, and how to quantify moisture in air using humidity ratio, vapor pressure and relative humidity. It also explains the concept of saturation and dew point and shows example calculations and chart-based reasoning to find dew point and moisture content.",
