    "lecture_summary": "The lecture derives how atmospheric pressure and density vary with altitude using the hydrostatic balance together with the ideal‑gas law and a linear lapse rate. It then derives the speed of sound from small acoustic perturbations using control‑volume mass and momentum balances and shows the thermodynamic form for an ideal adiabatic gas. Finally, these results are applied in a worked example analyzing a simple aircraft air‑refrigeration/cabin conditioning system (ram air, compressor, heat exchanger, turbine) including isentropic efficiency effects.",

      "steps": [
        "1) Setup: 1D control volume with undisturbed flow at pressure $p$, density $\\rho$ and a small disturbance (wave) travelling at speed $c$. Small perturbations: pressure $p+\\Delta p$, density $\\rho+\\Delta\\rho$, and particle velocity change $\\Delta V$. (See control-volume sketch.)",
        "2) Mass balance across the wave (conservation of mass). Using area $A$ and incoming mass flux $\\rho A c$ and outgoing $(\\rho+\\Delta\\rho)A(c-\\Delta V)$:  $$\\rho A c = (\\rho+\\Delta\\rho)A(c-\\Delta V)\\,.$$  Expand and neglect second-order product $\\Delta\\rho\\,\\Delta V$ to obtain the linear relation: $$\\rho\\,\\Delta V = c\\,\\Delta\\rho\\,.$$",
        "3) Momentum balance across the wave (conservation of momentum). Using mass flows and net pressure force $\\Sigma F = (p+\\Delta p)A - pA = \\Delta p\\,A$, the momentum equation reduces (after substituting mass fluxes and linearizing) to: $$-\\rho c\\,\\Delta V + \\Delta p = 0\\,.$$",
        "4) Eliminate $\\Delta V$ using mass relation $\\Delta V = \\dfrac{c\\,\\Delta\\rho}{\\rho}$ and substitute into momentum equation: $$-\\rho c\\left(\\dfrac{c\\,\\Delta\\rho}{\\rho}\\right) + \\Delta p = -c^2\\Delta\\rho + \\Delta p = 0\\,,$$ so $$\\Delta p = c^2\\Delta\\rho\\,.$$",
        "5) Take the small-perturbation limit $\\Delta\\rho\\to0$: $$c^2 = \\dfrac{dp}{d\\rho}\\,.$$",
        "6) For an adiabatic (isentropic) process with $p=C\\,\\rho^{\\gamma}$ (or $p\\rho^{-\\gamma}=\\text{const}$) compute derivative: $$\\dfrac{dp}{d\\rho}=\\gamma C\\rho^{\\gamma-1}=\\gamma\\dfrac{p}{\\rho}\\,.$$ Hence $$c^2=\\gamma\\dfrac{p}{\\rho}\\,.$$",
