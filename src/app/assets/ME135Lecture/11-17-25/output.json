    "lecture_summary": "The lecture develops the thermodynamic description of moist air by combining dry‑air and water‑vapor properties to obtain humid specific heat and moist‑air enthalpy. It shows how to separate sensible and latent heat contributions, applies mass and enthalpy balances to heating and cooling processes through a coil, and introduces the bypass‑ratio model for coils. A worked example uses a psychrometric chart and the bypass ratio to find exit dry‑bulb temperature, relative humidity, and the sensible heat added per kilogram of dry air.",
