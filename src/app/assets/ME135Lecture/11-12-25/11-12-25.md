## Derivations

### **Effectiveness–NTU relation for a parallel-flow heat exchanger**
**Stub:** Derive \(\displaystyle \varepsilon = \frac{1 - e^{-\mathrm{NTU}(1 + C_r)}}{1 + C_r} \) (and equivalent NTU inversion).

**Steps:**
1. 1) Define actual heat transfer and effectiveness: $$\dot{Q} = C_h( T_{hi} - T_{ho} ) = C_c( T_{co} - T_{ci} ),\quad \varepsilon = \frac{\dot{Q}}{\dot{Q}_{\max}}.$$
2. 2) Maximum possible heat transfer (if the fluid with minimum heat capacity were to undergo the maximum possible temperature change) gives $$\dot{Q}_{\max} = C_{\min}(T_{hi} - T_{ci}).$$ Hence one convenient expression for effectiveness is $$\varepsilon = \frac{T_{hi}-T_{ho}}{T_{hi}-T_{ci}} = \frac{T_{co}-T_{ci}}{C_r\,(T_{hi}-T_{ci})},$$ where $$C_r \equiv \frac{C_{\min}}{C_{\max}}.$$
3. 3) From the integrated energy/differential result (derived separately) we have the logarithmic relation between inlet/outlet temperature differences for a parallel flow exchanger: $$\ln\frac{T_{ho}-T_{co}}{T_{hi}-T_{ci}} = -\left(\frac{1}{C_h}+\frac{1}{C_c}\right)UA.$$
4. 4) Re-arrange the log relation in terms of C_min, C_max and C_r. Let \(C_{\min}=C_{\text{min}}\). Using \(\frac{1}{C_h}+\frac{1}{C_c} = \frac{1}{C_{\min}}\left(1 + C_r\right)\) (after identifying which side is min/max and defining \(C_r=C_{\min}/C_{\max}\)), and define the NTU number as $$\mathrm{NTU}\equiv\frac{UA}{C_{\min}}.$$ The logarithmic relation becomes $$\ln\frac{T_{ho}-T_{co}}{T_{hi}-T_{ci}} = -\mathrm{NTU}\,(1+C_r).$$
5. 5) Express the left-hand side in terms of effectiveness. Note that $$T_{ho}-T_{co} = (T_{hi}-T_{ci}) - (T_{hi}-T_{ho}) - (T_{co}-T_{ci}),$$ and using the definitions of \(\varepsilon\) and \(C_r\) we obtain an equation of the form $$1 - \varepsilon(1+C_r) = e^{-\mathrm{NTU}(1+C_r)}.$$
6. 6) Solve algebraically for \(\varepsilon\): $$\varepsilon = \frac{1 - e^{-\mathrm{NTU}(1+C_r)}}{1+C_r}.$$ This is the standard effectiveness–NTU relation for parallel flow (boxed).
7. 7) Invert to obtain NTU (useful if \(\varepsilon\) known): $$\mathrm{NTU} = -\frac{1}{1+C_r} \ln\left[1-\varepsilon(1+C_r)\right].$$
8. Completeness note: The derivation on the slides is complete — it shows the logarithmic integration step, substitution of \(UA/C_{\min}=\mathrm{NTU}\), and algebraic rearrangement to obtain the boxed result and the inverted NTU expression.

### **Differential energy balance for parallel flow and LMTD → integrated logarithmic relation**
**Stub:** Derive $$\ln\frac{T_{ho}-T_{co}}{T_{hi}-T_{ci}} = -\left(\frac{1}{C_h}+\frac{1}{C_c}\right)UA$$ and the LMTD expression for Q.

**Steps:**
1. 1) Consider an infinitesimal element of length \(\Delta x\). Energy balance on the hot fluid (capacity \(C_h\)) gives $$C_h\,[T_h(x)+\frac{dT_h}{dx}\Delta x - T_h(x)] = -\delta\dot q \;\Rightarrow\; C_h\frac{dT_h}{dx}\Delta x = -\delta\dot q.$$
2. 2) Similarly, cold fluid (capacity \(C_c\)) balance gives $$C_c\frac{dT_c}{dx}\Delta x = +\delta\dot q.$$
3. 3) Subtract the two to get the equation for the temperature difference: $$\frac{d}{dx}(T_h - T_c) = -\left(\frac{1}{C_h}+\frac{1}{C_c}\right)\delta\dot q/\Delta x.$$
4. 4) Relate local heat transfer to temperature difference through the heat transfer coefficient: $$\delta\dot q = U\,W\,\Delta x\,(T_h(x)-T_c(x)),$$ where \(W\) is the perimeter (so that \(UA = UWL\)).
5. 5) Substitute and separate variables: $$\frac{d(T_h-T_c)}{T_h-T_c} = -\left(\frac{1}{C_h}+\frac{1}{C_c}\right)U W\,dx.$$
6. 6) Integrate along the exchanger from inlet to outlet to obtain $$\ln\frac{T_{ho}-T_{co}}{T_{hi}-T_{ci}} = -\left(\frac{1}{C_h}+\frac{1}{C_c}\right)U W L = -\left(\frac{1}{C_h}+\frac{1}{C_c}\right) UA.$$
7. 7) Using the definition \(\mathrm{NTU}=UA/C_{\min}\) and algebra, this relation is the starting point for the effectiveness–NTU derivation. Separately, combining Q=UA(LMTD) yields the LMTD formula: $$\mathrm{LMTD}=\frac{\Delta T_i-\Delta T_o}{\ln(\Delta T_i/\Delta T_o)},\quad\dot Q = UA\times\mathrm{LMTD}.$$
8. Completeness note: The slide derivation is explicit for the differential balances and the integration; the step from the integrated log expression to the effectiveness form is carried out in the main derivation.

### **Special (limiting) case: C_r = 0 → \(\varepsilon = 1 - e^{-\mathrm{NTU}}\)**
**Stub:** Show that when the heat-capacity ratio \(C_r=0\) (one fluid has infinite capacity or C_min=0 limit), the parallel-flow (and all exchangers with C_r→0) effectiveness reduces to \(\varepsilon = 1 - e^{-\mathrm{NTU}}\).

**Steps:**
1. 1) Start from the general parallel-flow expression derived earlier: $$\varepsilon = \frac{1 - e^{-\mathrm{NTU}(1+C_r)}}{1+C_r}.$$
2. 2) Take the limit \(C_r\to 0\): the numerator becomes \(1 - e^{-\mathrm{NTU}}\) and denominator approaches 1, so $$\varepsilon\to 1 - e^{-\mathrm{NTU}}.$$
3. 3) The slides also show the alternative derivation for the case of an exchanger where the cold or hot side capacity is effectively infinite (all exchangers with \(C_r=0\)), giving the boxed relation $$\varepsilon = 1 - e^{-\mathrm{NTU}}.$$$
4. Completeness note: This is a straightforward limiting case algebraically obtained from the main result; the slides show the limiting expression explicitly.

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which of the following is the correct expression for the thermal effectiveness (ε) of a parallel‑flow heat exchanger in terms of NTU and the capacity ratio Cr (Cmin/Cmax)?

**Topics:** parallel‑flow heat exchangers, effectiveness (ε), NTU / capacity ratio (Cr)

**Options:**
- ✅ ε = [1 − exp(−NTU (1 + Cr))] / (1 + Cr)
- ε = 1 − exp(−NTU)
- ε = NTU / (1 + NTU)
- ε = [1 − exp(−NTU (1 − Cr))] / (1 − Cr)

**Explanation:** For parallel flow the derived effectiveness relation is ε = (1 − exp[−NTU(1+Cr)])/(1+Cr). The other formulas apply to special cases (ε = 1 − e^{−NTU} when Cr→0) or to other arrangements.

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=11
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which statement about the maximum possible heat transfer q̇_max for a two‑stream heat exchanger is correct?

**Topics:** heat capacity rates (Cmin/Cmax), maximum possible heat transfer, effectiveness definition

**Options:**
- ✅ q̇_max = C_min (T_h,in − T_c,in) — the smaller capacity rate limits maximum heat transfer.
- q̇_max = C_max (T_h,in − T_c,in) — the larger capacity rate determines the maximum.
- q̇_max is independent of flow rates and depends only on U and A.
- q̇_max equals the actual heat transfer q̇ for any exchanger with NTU > 0.

**Explanation:** q̇_max is the theoretical maximum heat that could be transferred if the smaller‑capacity fluid were brought to the inlet temperature of the other fluid; therefore q̇_max = C_min (T_h,in − T_c,in).

**Reference:** start_page=4 end_page=8
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** What is the definition of NTU used in the NTU–effectiveness method and what does it physically represent?

**Topics:** NTU definition, UA and C_min, physical meaning of NTU

**Options:**
- ✅ NTU = UA / C_min; it is a measure of the heat exchanger’s size/heat‑transfer ability relative to the thermal capacity of the smallest capacity stream.
- NTU = C_min / (UA); it is the ratio of flow heat capacity to overall heat transfer area.
- NTU = q̇ / (T_h,in − T_c,in); it directly equals the actual heat transfer.
- NTU = UA (no dependence on capacity rates); it only measures area and conductance.

**Explanation:** NTU is defined as UA/C_min. It indicates how effective the exchanger area and conductance are compared with the ability of the limiting (smallest C) fluid to absorb or release heat; larger NTU generally means higher effectiveness.
