    "lecture_summary": "The lecture analyzes reciprocating compressor behavior including the effect of clearance volume on compression cycles and volumetric efficiency, explains polytropic compression processes, and shows how clearance and pressure ratio affect delivered mass and work. It then extends to multi‑stage compression with intercooling, derives the condition for minimum work (optimal intermediate pressure), and reviews open/closed/isolated system definitions with control‑volume balances for mass and energy including relevant energy terms.",
