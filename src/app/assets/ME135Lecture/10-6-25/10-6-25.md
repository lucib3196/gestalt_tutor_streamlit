## Reciprocating Compressor Performance, Multistage Compression and Control‑Volume Balances

**Lecture Type:** mixed

### Summary
The lecture analyzes reciprocating compressor behavior including the effect of clearance volume on compression cycles and volumetric efficiency, explains polytropic compression processes, and shows how clearance and pressure ratio affect delivered mass and work.

## Derivations

### **Optimal intermediate pressure for two‑stage compression (perfect intercooling)**
**Stub:** Derive the intermediate pressure p2 that minimises total compression work for two stages with perfect intercooling (result: p2 = sqrt(p1 p3)).

**Steps:**
1. Write total work for two-stage polytropic compression (same effective mass factor for both stages):

$$W = \frac{n}{n-1}(m_1 - m_4)R T_1\left[\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} - 1\right] + \frac{n}{n-1}(m_1 - m_4)R T_1\left[\left(\frac{p_3}{p_2}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} - 1\right].$$
2. Factor the common prefactor to define the bracketed function φ(p2):

$$W = \frac{n}{n-1}(m_1-m_4)R T_1\,\Phi,\quad\text{where}\quad \Phi(p_2) = \left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\alpha} + \left(\frac{p_3}{p_2}\right)^{\alpha} - 2,\quad \alpha\equiv\frac{n-1}{n}.$$
3. To minimise W with respect to the intermediate pressure p2 set derivative zero (prefactor constant):

$$\frac{dW}{dp_2}=0 \;\Rightarrow\; \frac{d\Phi}{dp_2}=0.$$
4. Compute derivatives (use α=(n-1)/n):

- For the first term: $$\frac{d}{dp_2}\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\alpha} = \alpha p_1^{-\alpha} p_2^{\alpha-1}.$$ 
- For the second term: $$\frac{d}{dp_2}\left(\frac{p_3}{p_2}\right)^{\alpha} = \frac{d}{dp_2}\left(p_3^{\alpha} p_2^{-\alpha}\right) = -\alpha p_3^{\alpha} p_2^{-\alpha-1}.$$
5. Set sum to zero and simplify (divide by common factors):

$$\alpha p_1^{-\alpha} p_2^{\alpha-1} - \alpha p_3^{\alpha} p_2^{-\alpha-1} = 0.$$ 
Divide through by $\alpha p_2^{-\alpha-1}$ to get

$$p_1^{-\alpha} p_2^{2\alpha} - p_3^{\alpha}=0\quad\Rightarrow\quad p_2^{2\alpha} = p_1^{\alpha} p_3^{\alpha}.$$
6. Raise both sides to the power $1/\alpha$ (since $\alpha=(n-1)/n>0$):

$$(p_2^2) = (p_1 p_3) \quad\Rightarrow\quad p_2 = \sqrt{p_1 p_3}.$$
7. Conclude: the intermediate pressure that minimises total work for two equal polytropic stages with perfect intercooling is the geometric mean of the end pressures. Also implies equal stage pressure ratios: $p_2/p_1 = p_3/p_2$.
8. Completeness: derivation on pages 3–4 is complete — all algebraic steps from total work to the optimal condition and final closed‑form result are shown.

### **Single‑stage polytropic compression work (no clearance)**
**Stub:** Work required for polytropic compression from state 1 to state 2 (no clearance): $$W_{net} = \frac{n}{n-1}\,\dot m R T_1\left[\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} - 1\right].$$

**Steps:**
1. Polytropic compression relation: $p v^n = \text{const}$ and $T v^{n-1}=\text{const}$ used to relate pressures and temperatures.
2. Net work for a polytropic process (per unit mass flow) from p1 to p2: 

$$W_{net} = \frac{n}{n-1}\,\dot m R T_1\left[\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} - 1\right].$$
3. Reference/location: main formula and PV sketch appear on page 1.

### **Effect of clearance and volumetric efficiency for reciprocating compressor**
**Stub:** Work with clearance and definition of volumetric efficiency: $$W_{net}=\frac{n}{n-1}(m_1-m_4)R T_1\left[\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}-1\right],\quad \eta_{vol}=\frac{V_1-V_4}{V_s}.$$

**Steps:**
1. With clearance the effective mass compressed is proportional to (m1 - m4) so the net work becomes

$$W_{net}=\frac{n}{n-1}(m_1-m_4)R T_1\left[\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}-1\right].$$
2. Define volumetric efficiency as

$$\eta_{vol} \equiv \frac{V_1 - V_4}{V_s}.$$
3. Using V1 = Vc + Vs and algebra leads to

$$\eta_{vol}=1+\frac{V_c}{V_s}-\frac{V_4}{V_s} = 1 - K\left(r_p^{1/n}-1\right),$$
where $K=V_c/V_s$ is the clearance ratio and $r_p=p_2/p_1$ is the pressure ratio (this relation appears in the notes; algebraic steps connecting V4 via the polytropic relation are shown on pages 1–2).
4. Purpose: supports the main multi‑stage derivation by describing how clearance reduces effective mass and modifies stage work; used to justify common prefactors in the two‑stage W expression.

### **Control‑volume mass and energy balance (open system)**
**Stub:** General balance form: $$\dot X_{in} - \dot X_{out} + \dot X_{gen} + \dot X_{trans} = \frac{dX_{CV}}{dt}.$$ For mass and energy this gives the usual CV equations.

**Steps:**
1. General symbolic balance for an open system (quantity X):

$$\dot X_{in} - \dot X_{out} + \dot X_{gen} + \dot X_{trans} = \frac{dX_{CV}}{dt}.$$
2. Mass balance (special case X = mass):

$$\dot m_{in} - \dot m_{out} + \dot m_{gen} + \dot m_{trans} = \frac{dm_{CV}}{dt}.$$
3. Energy balance (X = energy):

$$\dot E_{in} - \dot E_{out} + \dot E_{gen} + (\dot Q - \dot W) = \frac{dE_{CV}}{dt},$$
with specific energy per unit mass typically written as $e= h + \tfrac{v^2}{2} + gz$ so that $E = m\left(h+\tfrac{v^2}{2}+gz\right)$.
4. Location: page 5. Purpose: provides background thermodynamic bookkeeping and is not directly used in the multi‑stage optimisation but is included in the lecture notes as a reminder of CV conservation equations.

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** How does clearance (clearance volume Vc) affect the volumetric efficiency ηvol of a single-stage polytropic reciprocating compressor, and which of the following expressions for ηvol (with clearance ratio K = Vc/Vs, pressure ratio rp = p2/p1, and polytropic exponent n) is correct?

**Topics:** Reciprocating compressor, Volumetric efficiency, Clearance ratio and polytropic compression

**Options:**
- ✅ ηvol = 1 - K (rp^{1/n} - 1)
- ηvol = 1 + K (rp^{1/n} - 1)
- ηvol = 1 - K (rp^{n} - 1)
- ηvol = 1 / [1 + K (rp^{1/n} - 1)]

**Explanation:** Clearance reduces the net drawn-in volume; deriving ηvol with Vc/Vs=K and polytropic re-expansion gives ηvol = 1 + Vc/Vs - rp^{1/n}·Vc/Vs which simplifies to ηvol = 1 - K (rp^{1/n} - 1).

**Reference:** start_page=1 end_page=2
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** For two-stage compression with perfect intercooling between stages (intercooler cools the gas back to the first-stage inlet temperature), what is the optimum intermediate pressure p2 (between inlet p1 and final pressure p3) that minimizes total work for equal polytropic index in both stages?

**Topics:** Multi-stage compression, Intercooling, Optimal intermediate pressure

**Options:**
- p2 = (p1 + p3) / 2 (arithmetic mean)
- ✅ p2 = sqrt(p1 · p3) (geometric mean)
- p2 = p3 (put all compression in the second stage)
- p2 = p1 (put all compression in the first stage)

**Explanation:** Minimizing the sum of stage works with perfect intercooling leads to equal pressure ratios for each stage, which gives p2 such that p2/p1 = p3/p2. Solving yields p2 = sqrt(p1·p3), the geometric mean.

**Reference:** start_page=3 end_page=4
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which statement correctly gives the general form of the conservation equation for an extensive property X in an open control volume and the typical form used for specific energy in the energy balance for flowing systems?

**Topics:** Control volume balances, Open systems (mass and energy), Flow energy (specific enthalpy and kinetic/potential energy)

**Options:**
- ✅ General: Ẋ_in - Ẋ_out + Ẋ_gen + Ẋ_trans = dX_CV/dt. Specific energy used in energy term: e = h + v^2/2 + gz.
- General: Ẋ_in + Ẋ_out + Ẋ_gen = dX_CV/dt. Specific energy: e = u (internal energy only).
- General: Ẋ_in - Ẋ_out = 0 always. Specific energy: e = c_p·T only.
- General: Ẋ_in - Ẋ_out + Ẋ_gen = 0 (no time derivative). Specific energy: e = pv only.

**Explanation:** The open-system (control-volume) accounting is Ẋ_in - Ẋ_out + Ẋ_gen + Ẋ_trans = dX_CV/dt. For energy balances in flows the energy carried per unit mass is expressed as h (flow enthalpy) plus kinetic and potential terms: h + v^2/2 + gz.
