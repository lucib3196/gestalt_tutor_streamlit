## Psychrometric Mixing and Cooling-Tower Mass/Energy Balances in a Steam Power Plant

**Lecture Type:** mixed

### Summary
The lecture demonstrates how to apply mass and energy balances together with psychrometric relations to solve two practical problems: (1) mixing two air streams (different temperatures and relative humidities) to find the exit dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, and (2) analysing condenser heat rejection into a cooling-water loop and a cooling tower to determine required air mass flow and makeup water at steady state. The material shows use of humidity ratio, moist-air enthalpy, saturation/partial pressures, and heat capacity of water within the context of a Rankine-cycle condenser and cooling tower.

## Derivations

### **Mass & Energy Balance for Cooling Tower — determine air mass flow and evaporation (makeup) rate**
**Stub:** Find \dot{m}_a (mass flow rate of air) and \dot{m}_3 (evaporated water / makeup flow) from energy and mass balances in the cooling tower given Q̇_c = 840 MW, cooling water 40°C→20°C, inlet air 25°C 35% RH, outlet air 35°C 90% RH.

**Steps:**
1. 1) Known / given: Q̇_c = 840×10^6 W (heat rejected by condenser, delivered to tower cooling water). Cooling-water temperature drop: T_b = 40°C (enters tower), T_a = 20°C (returns). Use cp_w = 4.187 kJ/(kg·K) (≈ 4.187 kJ/kg·°C).
2. 2) Heat balance on cooling water (assume all Q̇_c goes to heating the water stream):
```
Q̇_c = \dot{m}_w c_{p,w} (T_b - T_a)
```
Solve for \dot{m}_w:
```
\dot{m}_w = \dfrac{Q̇_c}{c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a)} = \dfrac{840×10^6}{4.187×10^3×(40-20)} = 10000\ \mathrm{kg/s}.
```
3. 3) Mass balance for evaporated water into the air: define humidity ratios (from psychrometric data taken in notes/tables):
- w_4 = 6.912 g/kg_da = 6.912×10^{-3} kg_v/kg_da (inlet air at 25°C, 35% RH)
- w_5 = 32.86 g/kg_da = 32.86×10^{-3} kg_v/kg_da (outlet air at 35°C, 90% RH)
Evaporation (mass of water transferred to air) is:
```
\dot{m}_3 = \dot{m}_a (w_5 - w_4).
```
4. 4) Write an energy (enthalpy) balance for the tower control volume (steady state). Using moist-air specific enthalpies h (kJ per kg dry air) from psychrometric tables and accounting for sensible heating of the evaporated liquid water, the algebra used in the notes is compacted to the form:
```
\dot{m}_a\Big[(w_5 - w_4) c_{p,w}(T_b - T_a) + h_4 - h_5\Big] = \dot{m}_w c_{p,w}(T_b - T_a)
```
This equation groups the energy required to evaporate and warm the evaporated water (first term) together with the change of moist-air enthalpy (h_4→h_5) on the left, equating them to the net energy removed from the water on the right.
5. 5) Substitute numeric property values used in the notes (units kJ/kg or kJ/kg_da; convert g/kg → kg/kg where needed):
- (w_5 - w_4) = (32.86 - 6.912)×10^{-3} = 0.025948 kg_v/kg_da
- c_{p,w} = 4.187 kJ/(kg·K)
- (T_b - T_a) = 40 - 20 = 20 K
- h_4 = 42.74 kJ/kg_da (moist-air enthalpy at inlet conditions)
- h_5 = 119.47 kJ/kg_da (moist-air enthalpy at outlet conditions)
- \dot{m}_w c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a) = 10000 × 4.187 × 20 = 837400 kJ/s (note sign usage below)

Compute the bracketed coefficient:
```
(w_5 - w_4) c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a) = 0.025948 × 4.187 × 20 = 2.173\ \mathrm{kJ/kg_{da}}
```
So bracket: 2.173 + 42.74 - 119.47 = -74.557 kJ/kg_da.
6. 6) Solve for \dot{m}_a:
```
\dot{m}_a = \dfrac{\dot{m}_w c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a)}{(w_5-w_4)c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a)+h_4-h_5}
= \dfrac{10000×4.187×20}{-74.557} \approx 11231\ \mathrm{kg/s}.
```
(Signs cancel because RHS and denominator are both negative in the numeric substitution used in the notes.)
7. 7) Compute evaporated (makeup) water rate \dot{m}_3:
```
\dot{m}_3 = \dot{m}_a (w_5 - w_4) = 11231 × 0.025948 ≈ 291.4\ \mathrm{kg/s}.
```
8. 8) Results (from the worked steps):
- Air mass flow: \dot{m}_a ≈ 11231 kg/s
- Evaporated (makeup) water: \dot{m}_3 ≈ 291.4 kg/s

Completeness/assumptions: The derivation is essentially complete for the calculation shown, but it relies on psychrometric property lookups (w_4, w_5, h_4, h_5) and the grouping of enthalpy terms into the compact algebraic form in step 4. Assumptions: steady state, negligible heat losses to ambient, drift/other water losses ignored except evaporation, cp_w ≈ constant, and moist-air enthalpies taken from tables.

### **Mixing of two air streams — exit dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity**
**Stub:** Mix two air streams (150 m^3/min at 24°C, 50% RH and 300 m^3/min at 40°C, 30% RH) to find mixed air T_3 and φ_3.

**Steps:**
1. 1) Convert volumetric flow to dry-air mass flow using specific volumes v_1, v_2 (from psychrometric tables):
```
\dot{m}_{a1} = \dfrac{\dot{V}_1}{v_1}, \quad \dot{m}_{a2} = \dfrac{\dot{V}_2}{v_2}.
```
(Numeric values used in notes: v_1 = 0.854 m^3/kg_da, v_2 = 0.907 m^3/kg_da → \dot{m}_{a1} = 175.6 kg/min, \dot{m}_{a2} = 330.76 kg/min.)
2. 2) Vapor mass flows: \dot{m}_{v1} = w_1 \dot{m}_{a1}, \dot{m}_{v2} = w_2 \dot{m}_{a2} (w in g/kg converted to kg/kg). Using w_1 = 9.336 g/kg and w_2 = 13.96 g/kg (from psychrometric table) the notes compute \dot{m}_{v1} ≈ 1.64 kg/min and \dot{m}_{v2} ≈ 4.5 kg/min, so \dot{m}_{v3} = \dot{m}_{v1}+\dot{m}_{v2} ≈ 6.1 kg/min.
3. 3) Dry-air mass out: \dot{m}_{a3} = \dot{m}_{a1} + \dot{m}_{a2} = 506.36 kg/min. Mixed humidity ratio:
```
w_3 = \dfrac{\dot{m}_{v3}}{\dot{m}_{a3}} = \dfrac{6.1}{506.36} = 0.01205\ \mathrm{kg_v/kg_da}.
```
4. 4) Energy (enthalpy) balance for mixing (assume negligible kinetic/potential work):
```
\dot{m}_{a1} h_1 + \dot{m}_{a2} h_2 = \dot{m}_{a3} h_3
```
Solve for h_3 and then relate moist-air enthalpy to dry-bulb temperature and humidity:
```
h_3 = c_{p,a} T_3 + w_3(2500 + 1.9 T_3)
```
Substitute numbers (h_3 computed ≈ 66.39 kJ/kg_da) and solve for T_3 → T_3 ≈ 35.3°C.
5. 5) Using T_3 = 35.3°C, find saturation pressure p_sat(35.3°C) and vapor partial pressure p_v3 = w_3 p / (0.622 + w_3) (using p = 101.325 kPa). Compute relative humidity:
```
φ_3 = p_{v3}/p_{sat} ≈ 0.336 ≈ 33.6%.
```
6. Completeness/assumptions: This derivation is complete given psychrometric table values used for v, w, h and the relation for moist-air enthalpy. It assumes steady mixing, no heat losses, and ideal psychrometric relations.

### **Simple condenser heat transfer used to find cooling-water mass flow**
**Stub:** Relate condenser heat rejection to cooling-water flow using Q̇ = \dot{m}_w c_p (T_b - T_a).

**Steps:**
1. Equation: Q̇_c = \dot{m}_w c_{p,w} (T_b - T_a).
2. Numeric substitution from notes: 840×10^6 = \dot{m}_w × 4.187×10^3 × (40 - 20) → \dot{m}_w = 10000 kg/s.
3. Purpose: provides the cooling-water mass flow used in the cooling-tower balances above.

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** When two streams of moist air mix adiabatically in a perfectly insulated duct (no heat loss to surroundings), which quantities are conserved and which must be used to determine the final mixed-air temperature and humidity ratio?

**Topics:** Psychrometrics, Mass balance (dry air and water vapour), Energy (enthalpy) balance

**Options:**
- ✅ Mass of dry air, mass of water vapour and total enthalpy are conserved; use mass balances for dry air and vapour plus an energy balance to find mixture temperature and humidity ratio.
- Only the dry-bulb temperatures of the two streams are conserved and the mixed temperature is the arithmetic mean of the two temperatures.
- Relative humidity of each stream is conserved during mixing, so the mixture RH is the average of the two inlet RH values.
- The humidity ratio of the mixture equals the humidity ratio of the hotter stream only.

**Explanation:** In adiabatic mixing the dry air mass is conserved (no leakage), water vapour mass from each stream adds to give total vapour, and energy (enthalpy) is conserved. Solve m_da and m_v mass balances plus total enthalpy balance to get the mixed temperature and humidity ratio.

 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** For a cooling tower operating at steady state where warm condenser water is cooled by counter-flow air and some water evaporates into the air, which statement correctly gives the makeup-water requirement?

**Topics:** Cooling tower water balance, Evaporative cooling and humidity change, Steady-state mass conservation

**Options:**
- ✅ Makeup water equals the mass of water evaporated into the air, which is the air mass flow rate multiplied by the increase in humidity ratio (m_dot_air · (ω_out − ω_in)).
- Makeup water equals the total heat rejected by the condenser divided by the water specific heat (Q̇_c / (c_p,w · ΔT)), independent of the air humidity change.
- No makeup water is required at steady state because all evaporated water returns as condensate to the condenser.
- Makeup water equals the air mass flow rate (m_dot_air), since all incoming air becomes saturated water in the tower.

**Explanation:** At steady state the liquid water lost from the cooling circuit must be replaced by makeup. The primary loss is evaporation into the air, so m_makeup = m_evaporated = m_air·(ω_out − ω_in). The heat rejection determines the water temperature change but not directly the evaporative mass without the humidity change.

 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** In a Rankine-cycle power plant, given thermal efficiency η = Ẇ / Q̇_in, which relationship between heat input Q̇_in, turbine work Ẇ and heat rejected in the condenser Q̇_out is correct?

**Topics:** Rankine cycle energy balance, First law for steady-flow devices, Definition of thermal efficiency

**Options:**
- ✅ Q̇_out = Q̇_in − Ẇ (energy conservation: input heat = turbine work + rejected heat).
- Q̇_out = Ẇ / η (condenser heat equals work divided by efficiency).
- Ẇ = Q̇_out − Q̇_in (work equals rejected heat minus input heat).
- η = Q̇_out / Q̇_in, so condenser heat divided by input heat gives thermal efficiency.

**Explanation:** Apply the first law to the cycle: Q̇_in = Ẇ + Q̇_out. Rearranging gives Q̇_out = Q̇_in − Ẇ. Efficiency η is defined as Ẇ/Q̇_in, not Q̇_out/Q̇_in.
