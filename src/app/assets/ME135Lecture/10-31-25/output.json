    "lecture_summary": "The lecture demonstrates how to apply mass and energy balances together with psychrometric relations to solve two practical problems: (1) mixing two air streams (different temperatures and relative humidities) to find the exit dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, and (2) analysing condenser heat rejection into a cooling-water loop and a cooling tower to determine required air mass flow and makeup water at steady state. The material shows use of humidity ratio, moist-air enthalpy, saturation/partial pressures, and heat capacity of water within the context of a Rankine-cycle condenser and cooling tower.",

  "derivations": [
    {
      "derivation_title": "Mass & Energy Balance for Cooling Tower — determine air mass flow and evaporation (makeup) rate",
      "derivation_stub": "Find \\dot{m}_a (mass flow rate of air) and \\dot{m}_3 (evaporated water / makeup flow) from energy and mass balances in the cooling tower given Q̇_c = 840 MW, cooling water 40°C→20°C, inlet air 25°C 35% RH, outlet air 35°C 90% RH.",
      "steps": [
        "1) Known / given: Q̇_c = 840×10^6 W (heat rejected by condenser, delivered to tower cooling water). Cooling-water temperature drop: T_b = 40°C (enters tower), T_a = 20°C (returns). Use cp_w = 4.187 kJ/(kg·K) (≈ 4.187 kJ/kg·°C).",
        "2) Heat balance on cooling water (assume all Q̇_c goes to heating the water stream):\n```\nQ̇_c = \\dot{m}_w c_{p,w} (T_b - T_a)\n```\nSolve for \\dot{m}_w:\n```\n\\dot{m}_w = \\dfrac{Q̇_c}{c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a)} = \\dfrac{840×10^6}{4.187×10^3×(40-20)} = 10000\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}.\n```",
        "3) Mass balance for evaporated water into the air: define humidity ratios (from psychrometric data taken in notes/tables):\n- w_4 = 6.912 g/kg_da = 6.912×10^{-3} kg_v/kg_da (inlet air at 25°C, 35% RH)\n- w_5 = 32.86 g/kg_da = 32.86×10^{-3} kg_v/kg_da (outlet air at 35°C, 90% RH)\nEvaporation (mass of water transferred to air) is:\n```\n\\dot{m}_3 = \\dot{m}_a (w_5 - w_4).\n```",
        "4) Write an energy (enthalpy) balance for the tower control volume (steady state). Using moist-air specific enthalpies h (kJ per kg dry air) from psychrometric tables and accounting for sensible heating of the evaporated liquid water, the algebra used in the notes is compacted to the form:\n```\n\\dot{m}_a\\Big[(w_5 - w_4) c_{p,w}(T_b - T_a) + h_4 - h_5\\Big] = \\dot{m}_w c_{p,w}(T_b - T_a)\n```\nThis equation groups the energy required to evaporate and warm the evaporated water (first term) together with the change of moist-air enthalpy (h_4→h_5) on the left, equating them to the net energy removed from the water on the right.",
        "5) Substitute numeric property values used in the notes (units kJ/kg or kJ/kg_da; convert g/kg → kg/kg where needed):\n- (w_5 - w_4) = (32.86 - 6.912)×10^{-3} = 0.025948 kg_v/kg_da\n- c_{p,w} = 4.187 kJ/(kg·K)\n- (T_b - T_a) = 40 - 20 = 20 K\n- h_4 = 42.74 kJ/kg_da (moist-air enthalpy at inlet conditions)\n- h_5 = 119.47 kJ/kg_da (moist-air enthalpy at outlet conditions)\n- \\dot{m}_w c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a) = 10000 × 4.187 × 20 = 837400 kJ/s (note sign usage below)\n\nCompute the bracketed coefficient:\n```\n(w_5 - w_4) c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a) = 0.025948 × 4.187 × 20 = 2.173\\ \\mathrm{kJ/kg_{da}}\n```\nSo bracket: 2.173 + 42.74 - 119.47 = -74.557 kJ/kg_da.",
        "6) Solve for \\dot{m}_a:\n```\n\\dot{m}_a = \\dfrac{\\dot{m}_w c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a)}{(w_5-w_4)c_{p,w}(T_b-T_a)+h_4-h_5}\n= \\dfrac{10000×4.187×20}{-74.557} \\approx 11231\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}.\n```\n(Signs cancel because RHS and denominator are both negative in the numeric substitution used in the notes.)",
        "7) Compute evaporated (makeup) water rate \\dot{m}_3:\n```\n\\dot{m}_3 = \\dot{m}_a (w_5 - w_4) = 11231 × 0.025948 ≈ 291.4\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}.\n```",
        "8) Results (from the worked steps):\n- Air mass flow: \\dot{m}_a ≈ 11231 kg/s\n- Evaporated (makeup) water: \\dot{m}_3 ≈ 291.4 kg/s\n\nCompleteness/assumptions: The derivation is essentially complete for the calculation shown, but it relies on psychrometric property lookups (w_4, w_5, h_4, h_5) and the grouping of enthalpy terms into the compact algebraic form in step 4. Assumptions: steady state, negligible heat losses to ambient, drift/other water losses ignored except evaporation, cp_w ≈ constant, and moist-air enthalpies taken from tables."

        "2) Vapor mass flows: \\dot{m}_{v1} = w_1 \\dot{m}_{a1}, \\dot{m}_{v2} = w_2 \\dot{m}_{a2} (w in g/kg converted to kg/kg). Using w_1 = 9.336 g/kg and w_2 = 13.96 g/kg (from psychrometric table) the notes compute \\dot{m}_{v1} ≈ 1.64 kg/min and \\dot{m}_{v2} ≈ 4.5 kg/min, so \\dot{m}_{v3} = \\dot{m}_{v1}+\\dot{m}_{v2} ≈ 6.1 kg/min.",
        "3) Dry-air mass out: \\dot{m}_{a3} = \\dot{m}_{a1} + \\dot{m}_{a2} = 506.36 kg/min. Mixed humidity ratio:\n```\nw_3 = \\dfrac{\\dot{m}_{v3}}{\\dot{m}_{a3}} = \\dfrac{6.1}{506.36} = 0.01205\\ \\mathrm{kg_v/kg_da}.\n```",
        "4) Energy (enthalpy) balance for mixing (assume negligible kinetic/potential work):\n```\n\\dot{m}_{a1} h_1 + \\dot{m}_{a2} h_2 = \\dot{m}_{a3} h_3\n```\nSolve for h_3 and then relate moist-air enthalpy to dry-bulb temperature and humidity:\n```\nh_3 = c_{p,a} T_3 + w_3(2500 + 1.9 T_3)\n```\nSubstitute numbers (h_3 computed ≈ 66.39 kJ/kg_da) and solve for T_3 → T_3 ≈ 35.3°C.",
        "5) Using T_3 = 35.3°C, find saturation pressure p_sat(35.3°C) and vapor partial pressure p_v3 = w_3 p / (0.622 + w_3) (using p = 101.325 kPa). Compute relative humidity:\n```\nφ_3 = p_{v3}/p_{sat} ≈ 0.336 ≈ 33.6%.\n```",
