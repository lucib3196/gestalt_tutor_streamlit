## Thermodynamic properties of ideal gases: specific heats, entropy and constant-pressure processes

**Lecture Type:** mixed

### Summary

An introduction to basic thermodynamic properties for ideal gases, focusing on specific heats (at constant pressure and volume), their interrelation with the gas constant and the adiabatic index, the first law of thermodynamics (energy balance and pdV work), and entropy changes. The lecture applies these concepts to evaluate heat, work, internal energy and entropy for a constant-pressure process.

### Core Topics

- Thermodynamic state properties (p, v, T, u, h, s)
- Specific heat at constant pressure (Cp)
- Specific heat at constant volume (Cv)
- Relation between Cp, Cv, gas constant and adiabatic index
- Gibbs phase rule
- First law of thermodynamics and pdV work
- Entropy and its differential definition
- Entropy change for an ideal gas (T–V and T–P forms)
- Constant-pressure process: work, heat transfer and entropy change

## Derivations

### **Entropy change for an ideal gas (general form and special cases)**

**Stub:** Derive expressions for the change in specific entropy for an ideal gas: $$\Delta s = C_v\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1} + R\ln\frac{v_2}{v_1}$$ and the equivalent pressure form $$\Delta s = C_p\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1} - R\ln\frac{p_2}{p_1}$$; special case at constant pressure $$\Delta s = C_p\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}.$$

**Steps:**

1. Start from Clausius definition: $$ds = \frac{\delta q}{T}.$$
2. Apply first law for a closed system with only PV-work: $$\delta q = du + \delta w = du + p\,dv.$$ Therefore $$ds = \frac{du + p\,dv}{T}.$$
3. Use ideal-gas EOS: $$p v = R T \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{p}{T} = \frac{R}{v}.$$ Substitute into ds to rewrite pressure-term when convenient.
4. Express internal-energy differential for an ideal gas (definition of Cv): assume $$u=u(v,T)$$ and for an ideal gas $$(\partial u/\partial v)_T = 0$$ so $$du = C_v\,dT,$$ where $$C_v \equiv \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial T}\right)_v.$$
5. Substitute $du=C_v\,dT$ into ds and use $p/T = R/v$ to get: $$ds = \frac{C_v\,dT}{T} + R\frac{dv}{v}.$$ (Note: this step assumes $C_v$ constant if integrating analytically.)
6. Integrate between states 1 and 2: $$\Delta s = \int_{1}^{2} \frac{C_v\,dT}{T} + R\int_{1}^{2}\frac{dv}{v} = C_v\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1} + R\ln\frac{v_2}{v_1}.$$ (Boxed result on slides.)
7. Alternate route using enthalpy: define $$h\equiv u + p v$$ and differential $$dh = du + d(pv) = du + p\,dv + v\,dp.$$ Then $$\delta q = dh - v\,dp$$ and $$ds = \frac{dh - v\,dp}{T}.$$
8. For an ideal gas, $$dh = C_p\,dT,\quad C_p \equiv \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial T}\right)_p.$$ Also use $$v = \frac{R T}{p}$$ so $$\frac{v}{T} = \frac{R}{p}.$$ Substitute into ds:
9. $$ds = \frac{C_p\,dT}{T} - \frac{v\,dp}{T} = \frac{C_p\,dT}{T} - R\frac{dp}{p}.$$
10. Integrate 1→2 to get the pressure-form: $$\Delta s = C_p\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1} - R\ln\frac{p_2}{p_1}.$$ (Boxed on slides.)
11. Recover constant-pressure special case by setting $p_1=p_2$: $$\Delta s = C_p\ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}.$$
12. Assumptions and completeness: derivation assumes (i) ideal-gas EOS $pv=RT$, (ii) only PV-work, and (iii) constant specific heats ($C_v, C_p$) for the closed-form integrals. The slides explicitly note the constant-Cv/Cp assumption; otherwise the integrals remain valid as formal integrals with temperature-dependent capacities.

### **Relation between heat capacities: $C_p - C_v = R$ and gamma relations**

**Stub:** Show for an ideal gas that $$C_p - C_v = R$$ and define the adiabatic index $$\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v}$$ leading to $$C_v = \frac{R}{\gamma-1},\quad C_p=\frac{\gamma R}{\gamma-1}.$$

**Steps:**

1. Start from definitions: $$C_v \equiv \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial T}\right)_v,\qquad C_p \equiv \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial T}\right)_p.$$
2. Use enthalpy relation $$h = u + p v$$ and take differentials: $$dh = du + d(pv).$$ For an ideal gas $pv=RT$ so $$d(pv)=R\,dT.$$
3. Substitute $du = C_v\,dT$ and $dh=C_p\,dT$ to obtain $$C_p\,dT = C_v\,dT + R\,dT.$$ Divide by dT:
4. $$C_p - C_v = R.$$
5. Define $$\gamma \equiv \frac{C_p}{C_v}$$ so $C_p=\gamma C_v$. Substitute into $C_p-C_v=R$ and solve:
6. $$\gamma C_v - C_v = R \Rightarrow C_v = \frac{R}{\gamma-1},\quad C_p=\frac{\gamma R}{\gamma-1}.$$
7. Location and note: this derivation appears earlier (slides/pages) and is used in later relations involving specific heats and entropy. The slides present this as a complete algebraic derivation.

### **Work for a quasi‑static piston (PV-work expression)**

**Stub:** Show that the elemental mechanical work for piston displacement is $$\delta w = p\,dV$$.

**Steps:**

1. Consider a piston of face area A displaced by distance dx under pressure p. Force on piston: $$F = pA.$$
2. Elementary work: $$\delta w = F\,dx = pA\,dx = p\,dV$$ since $dV = A\,dx$ (piston volume change).
3. This gives the standard PV-work expression used in the First Law substitution for closed systems.

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**

**Question:** Which relation is always true for an ideal gas (per the lecture)?

**Topics:** Specific heats (Cp, Cv), Ideal gas relations, Thermodynamic identities

**Options:**

- ✅ Cp - Cv = R
- Cp = Cv
- Cp/Cv = R
- Cv = 0 for an ideal gas

**Explanation:** For an ideal gas the Mayer relation holds: Cp - Cv = R. The ratio Cp/Cv is the heat-capacity ratio γ, not R.

### **Conceptual Question**

**Question:** Which expression gives the change in specific entropy Δs for an ideal gas (assuming Cv is constant) in terms of temperature and specific volume?

**Topics:** Entropy, Ideal gas, Thermodynamic differentials

**Options:**

- ✅ Δs = Cv ln(T2/T1) + R ln(v2/v1)
- Δs = Cp ln(T2/T1) + R ln(v2/v1)
- Δs = Cv ln(T2/T1) - R ln(p2/p1)
- Δs = R ln(T2/T1) + Cv ln(v2/v1)

**Explanation:** Starting from ds = du/T + p d v / T and using du = Cv dT and p v = R T leads to Δs = ∫Cv dT/T + ∫R dv/v = Cv ln(T2/T1) + R ln(v2/v1).

### **Conceptual Question**

**Question:** Using the sign convention in the lecture (Δu = Q - W), what does a positive W indicate?

**Topics:** First law of thermodynamics, Sign conventions, Work

**Options:**

- ✅ Work done by the system
- Work done on the system
- Heat added to the system
- No work is exchanged

**Explanation:** With Δu = Q - W the term W denotes work done by the system; W > 0 means energy leaves as work (work done by the system), while W < 0 corresponds to work done on the system.
