    "lecture_title": "Reversed Brayton cycle, atmospheric hydrostatics and compressible-flow stagnation relations",
    "lecture_summary": "The lecture first sketches the reversed Brayton (gas refrigeration) cycle and its practical use for cooling/cabin air. It then derives the hydrostatic equation for a vertical air column and integrates it with the ideal-gas law under different temperature assumptions (constant lapse rate, adiabatic/polytropic relations) to obtain how pressure and density vary with altitude and to obtain the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Finally it develops stagnation (total) temperature and pressure relations for compressible flow, introduces the speed of sound and Mach number, and relates total-to-static temperature and pressure ratios to flow velocity.",
