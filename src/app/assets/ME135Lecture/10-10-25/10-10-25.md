## Reversed Brayton cycle, atmospheric hydrostatics and compressible-flow stagnation relations

**Lecture Type:** mixed

### Summary
The lecture first sketches the reversed Brayton (gas refrigeration) cycle and its practical use for cooling/cabin air. It then derives the hydrostatic equation for a vertical air column and integrates it with the ideal-gas law under different temperature assumptions (constant lapse rate, adiabatic/polytropic relations) to obtain how pressure and density vary with altitude and to obtain the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Finally it develops stagnation (total) temperature and pressure relations for compressible flow, introduces the speed of sound and Mach number, and relates total-to-static temperature and pressure ratios to flow velocity.

## Derivations

### **Pressure variation with altitude (barometric formula with linear lapse)**
**Stub:** Derive p(z)/p0 = \left(1 - \Gamma z / T_0\right)^{g/(R\Gamma)} from hydrostatic balance and an assumed linear temperature lapse (complete)

**Steps:**
1. Start from a vertical force balance on a small rectangular parcel (hydrostatic equilibrium). Summing forces in z: $$-p(x,y,z+\tfrac{\Delta z}{2})\,\Delta x\Delta y + p(x,y,z-\tfrac{\Delta z}{2})\,\Delta x\Delta y - \rho\,\Delta x\Delta y\,\Delta z\,g = 0.$$
2. Taylor-expand top and bottom pressures about z: $$p\left(z+\tfrac{\Delta z}{2}\right)\approx p(z)+\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\frac{\Delta z}{2},\qquad p\left(z-\tfrac{\Delta z}{2}\right)\approx p(z)-\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\frac{\Delta z}{2}.$$
3. Substitute expansions into force balance, cancel common terms, divide by volume and take the limit \(\Delta z\to0\) to obtain the differential hydrostatic equation: $$\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = -\rho g.$$
4. Use the ideal gas relation for air: $$p=\rho R T \quad\Rightarrow\quad \rho=\frac{p}{R T}.$$ Substitute into hydrostatic equation to get $$\frac{1}{p}\frac{dp}{dz} = -\frac{g}{R\,T(z)}.$$
5. Assume a linear temperature profile (constant lapse rate): $$T(z)=T_0-\Gamma z\quad(\Gamma=\text{lapse rate}).$$ Integrate from z=0 (p=p_0) to z: $$\int_{p_0}^{p(z)}\frac{1}{p}\,dp = -\int_{0}^{z}\frac{g}{R\,(T_0-\Gamma z')}\,dz'.$$
6. Carry out the integral: $$\ln\frac{p(z)}{p_0}=\frac{g}{R\Gamma}\ln\frac{T_0-\Gamma z}{T_0}.$$
7. Exponentiate to obtain the barometric formula with linear lapse: $$\boxed{\displaystyle\frac{p(z)}{p_0}=\left(1-\frac{\Gamma z}{T_0}\right)^{\,g/(R\Gamma)}.}$$
8. Comment on domain/assumption: this expression requires \(T_0-\Gamma z>0\) (small enough z) and assumes constant lapse rate \(\Gamma\) and ideal-gas behaviour. The derivation as shown on the slides is complete under these assumptions.

### **Adiabatic (isentropic) atmosphere — pressure/density relation and adiabatic lapse rate**
**Stub:** Derive temperature lapse for an adiabatic atmosphere: \Gamma_ad = \dfrac{g}{R}\left(\dfrac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right) (supporting derivation)

**Steps:**
1. Start from isentropic relation (for an ideal gas): $$p\propto\rho^{\gamma}\quad\Rightarrow\quad p= C\,\rho^{\gamma}.$$
2. Express density in terms of pressure: $$\rho=\rho_0\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)^{1/\gamma}.$$
3. Hydrostatic balance gives $$\frac{dp}{dz}=-\rho g = -\rho_0\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)^{1/\gamma}g.$$ Rearranged and integrated (details shown in slides) yields a p(z)–ρ(z) relation consistent with an adiabatic profile.
4. Use ideal-gas law and isentropic relations to derive the temperature gradient (dry adiabatic lapse rate): $$\boxed{\displaystyle \Gamma_{ad} = \frac{g}{R}\,\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}.}$$
5. Numerical substitution (slides): using \(g=9.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2},\ R\approx287\,\mathrm{J/(kg\,K)},\ \gamma\approx1.4\) gives \(\Gamma_{ad}\approx9.7\,\mathrm{K/km}\) (the dry adiabatic lapse rate; slides note typical observed lapse rates ~6–7 K/km due to moisture and other effects).

### **Stagnation (total) temperature and Mach number relation**
**Stub:** Derive the stagnation temperature relation: \(T_s = T\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}\mathrm{Ma}^2\right)\) (supporting derivation)

**Steps:**
1. Begin from steady-flow energy (per unit mass) for an ideal gas with no work or heat: $$h+\frac{V^2}{2}=h_s\quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{V^2}{2}=h_s-h.$$
2. For a perfect gas use enthalpy \(h=c_p T\) so $$\frac{V^2}{2}=c_p(T_s-T)\quad\Rightarrow\quad T_s=T+\frac{V^2}{2c_p}.$$
3. Express \(c_p\) and the speed of sound: \(c_p=\dfrac{\gamma R}{\gamma-1}\) and \(a^2=\gamma R T\). Define Mach number \(\mathrm{Ma}=V/a\). Substitute to get the standard stagnation temperature relation: $$\boxed{\displaystyle T_s = T\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}\mathrm{Ma}^2\right).}$$

## Questions

## Conceptual Questions### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which differential relation expresses the hydrostatic balance used to derive how pressure varies with altitude for a stationary atmosphere?

**Topics:** Hydrostatic equilibrium, Pressure variation with altitude, Forces in a fluid column

**Options:**
- ✅ dp/dz = -ρ g
- dp/dz = +ρ g
- dp/dz = -g
- dp/dz = -ρ g / p

**Explanation:** Hydrostatic balance comes from vertical force equilibrium on a fluid element: upward pressure from below minus downward pressure from above equals weight, which gives dp/dz = -ρ g.

 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Using an adiabatic (dry) atmosphere model, which of the following is the best estimate of the dry adiabatic lapse rate (Γd) for air (γ = 1.4, R = 287 J·kg⁻¹·K⁻¹)?

**Topics:** Adiabatic atmosphere, Lapse rate, Thermodynamic properties of air

**Options:**
- ✅ Approximately 9.8 K per km
- Approximately 6.5 K per km (typical environmental lapse rate)
- Approximately 3.5 K per km
- Approximately 15 K per km

**Explanation:** The dry adiabatic lapse rate is Γd = g/cp. Using cp = R γ/(γ−1) and γ = 1.4 gives Γd ≈ g/R·(γ−1)/γ ≈ 9.8 K/km.

**Reference:** start_page=4 end_page=5
 ### **Conceptual Question**
**Question:** Which relation correctly gives the stagnation (total) temperature Ts in terms of static temperature T and Mach number Ma for a perfect gas?

**Topics:** Stagnation (total) properties, Mach number, Compressible flow relations

**Options:**
- ✅ Ts = T [1 + (γ−1)/2 · Ma²]
- Ts = T [1 + (γ+1)/2 · Ma²]
- Ts = T + V²/(2R)
- Ts = T · sqrt(1 + (γ−1) Ma²)

**Explanation:** For adiabatic (no-heat) deceleration to stagnation, Ts = T + V²/(2 cp). Using Ma = V/c and c² = γ R T and cp = γR/(γ−1) gives Ts = T[1 + (γ−1)/2 · Ma²].
