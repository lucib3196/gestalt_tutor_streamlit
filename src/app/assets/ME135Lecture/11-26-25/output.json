    "lecture_title": "Laminar Internal Flow in Circular Pipes: Velocity, Pressure Drop, Friction and Heat Transfer",
    "lecture_summary": "The lecture develops the theory of steady, fully-developed laminar flow in pipes. Starting from a force balance on a pipe element, it derives the parabolic velocity profile (Hagen–Poiseuille solution), relates centerline and mean velocities, and obtains expressions for volumetric flow rate and pressure drop. From the velocity field the wall shear stress, friction velocity and laminar friction factors (Darcy and Fanning forms) are derived and expressed in terms of Reynolds number. The lecture finishes by treating the thermal problem for fully-developed laminar flow with constant wall temperature, producing the temperature profile, heat transfer coefficient and the constant Nusselt number for that case, and discusses hydraulic diameter for non-circular ducts.",

(Complete for assumptions listed.)",
      "steps": [
        "1) Force balance on a cylindrical fluid element (axial momentum, steady):\n\n$$p(x)A - p(x+\\Delta x)A - \\tau_w P\\Delta x = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; -\\frac{dp}{dx}A = \\tau_w P$$\n\nso the local shear from the pressure gradient is\n\n$$\\tau_w = -\\frac{dp}{dx}\\frac{A}{P}\\;.$$",
        "2) For a circular pipe (radius $R$) the area/perimeter ratio is $A/P = \\dfrac{\\pi R^2}{2\\pi R} = \\dfrac{R}{2}$. More generally the shear at radius $r$ from the same balance gives\n\n$$\\tau(r) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dp}{dx}\\,r\\;.$$",
        "3) Constitutive relation (Newtonian fluid) and sign convention:\n\n$$\\tau(r) = -\\mu\\frac{du}{dr}\\;.$$\n\nCombine with the expression for $\\tau(r)$ to form the ODE:\n\n$$\\mu\\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dp}{dx}\\,r\\;.$$",

        "9) Assumptions / completeness: derivation assumes steady, incompressible, Newtonian fluid, axisymmetric fully-developed flow (\\partial u/\\partial x=0), no-slip at the wall and constant properties. Under these assumptions the derivation is complete up to the final results $u(r)=u_{max}(1-r^2/R^2)$, $\\bar u = u_{max}/2$, $\\Delta p = 32\\mu\\bar u L/D^2$, and $f_D=64/\\mathrm{Re}$."
